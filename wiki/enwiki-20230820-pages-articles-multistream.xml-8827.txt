[[Pedra de Itapuca]]

CATEGORIES: Niterói

Pedra de Itapuca is a rock formation that is located between Praia de Icaraí, in the neighborhood of Icaraí and Praia das Flechas, in the neighborhood of Ingá, in the municipality of Niterói, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is one of the symbols of the city of Niterói. The waters around it are a traditional surfing spot in the city.

==Etymology==

"Itapuca" is a term of Tupi origin, meaning "cleft stone", through the junction of the terms itá (stone) and puca (cleft). The name is a reference to the old shape of Pedra de Itapuca, before it was imploded, in 1840, for the street of the region.

The stone formed a natural arc with the mainland, hence its Tupi name meaning "split stone". With the implosion, the arch was undone, leaving it, currently, only a rocky pillar in the sea, a few meters from the mainland.

[[Disappearance of Denise Pipitone]]

CATEGORIES: Kidnapping, September 2004 events in Europe, Missing Italian children, 2004 in Italy

Denise Pipitone (born October 26, 2000) is an Italian missing girl, who disappeared on September 1, 2004, while she was near the house of her maternal grandmother, in Mazara del Vallo.

==Disappearance==

On the morning of September 1, 2004, Denise Pipitone, daughter of Piera Maggio and Pietro Pulizzi (but legally listed as legitimate daughter of Tony Pipitone, at the time regularly married with Piera Maggio but unaware of not being the real father), disappeared from Mazara del Vallo, her birthplace, in front of her house. She was last seen by her aunt Giacoma, sister of Piera Maggio, at 11:45 AM, on the sidewalk near the street; Denise was left on her own, after her cousin went home for lunch. At the time of the disappearance Piera Maggio, mother of Denise, was taking a computer course and learned of the incident at around 12:30 PM. The news was spread through the local media at 2 PM, and quickly became a national case. The investigations, carried out over the years, indicate a hypothetical abduction as a cause of the vanishing, managed through a displacement among several anonymous individuals, which aimed to put everyone off the track.

The hounds of the investigation team perceived the presence of Denise nearby the property of the sister of Gaspare Ghaleb (at the time fiancé of Jessica Pulizzi, daughter of Anna Corona and Pietro Pulizzi, the biological father of Denise), only a few meters away from the apartment of Giacoma Maggio, building in front of which Denise was seen by her aunt for the last time. Jessica, at the time, was only 17 and was one of the main suspects in the abduction, along with her mother.

==Sightings==

As a result of the disappearance, the research began immediately, although without any result for over a month.

Some sightings, both confirmed and unconfirmed, were subsequently reported:

During the years, various theories were presented the investigators, but the inquiries always focused within the family.

The theory of gypsies was often a constant, but it was never confirmed, even though some speculate about a connection with the family: it seems plausible that the little girl was traded to nomadic groups or to someone in the circle of friends of the family.

On May 3, 2021 the public prosecutor of Marsala opened another investigation on the case and, on May 27, a new parliamentary committee of inquiry was requested by deputees Alessia Morani and Carmelo Miceli, members of the Democratic Party, in order to analyze potential false leads, conflicts of interest and anomalies in the previous 17 years of investigations. However the matter remained unchanged until December 20, the day when the investigating judge of Marsala dismissed the case.

==Trials==

According to the last reconstruction of the prosecutors, Denise was abducted by Jessica Pulizzi, with the complicity of her mother, Anna Corona - to which Piero Pulizzi never confessed that Denise was his daughter, even though they suspected the fact - and of her ex-fiancé, Gaspare Ghaleb. The reason was «revenge and jealousy because Denise and Jessica Pulizzi are daughters of the same father, Piero Pulizzi». The inquiry into Anna Corona, under investigation in a second line of research for child abduction, was closed by the investigating judge of Marsala in December 2013.

Jessica Pulizzi, charged with complicity in kidnapping a minor, was arraigned by the preliminary hearing judge of Marsala, on January 18, 2010. The first instance trial began on March 16, 2010, lasting for over three years. The public prosecutor of Marsala recommended the sentence of 15 years of imprisonment for child abduction, deeming her "undoubtedly guilty" due to a series of clear, unambiguous and convergent clues. According to the indictment, on the morning of September 1, 2004, Pulizzi took Denise to the home of Piero Pulizzi to confirm that she was his daughter, but, not finding him, handed the child to unidentified people.

However, upon completion of the trial, the woman was acquitted by the Court of Marsala, on June 27, 2013, for lack of evidence, and on October 2, 2015 the Court of Appeal of Palermo confirmed the acquittal, rejecting the request for the sentence to 15 years of imprisonment, asked by the head prosecutor of the Court of Appeal of Palermo, Rosalba Scaduto. Scaduto, during her indictment, claimed that Jessica Pulizzi had taken part in the abduction of Denise, and therefore should be found guilty. On April 19, 2017 the Court of Cassation confirmed the final acquittal of Jessica Pulizzi, but at the same time points to the existence of a valid and proven motive. At the end of the second-degree trial, the statute of limitations intervened against the charges of the co-defendant.

[[Nelly (1798 ship)]]

CATEGORIES: 1798 ships, Age of Sail merchant ships of England, Liverpool slave ships, Captured ships

Nelly was launched at Liverpool in 1798. She initially sailed as a West Indiaman. From 1803 she made two complete voyages as a slave ship in the triangular trade in enslaved people. Spanish privateers captured her in 1805 while she was on her third slave voyage after she had embarked slaves.

==Career==

Nelly first appeared in Lloyd's Register in 1799. Captain Seacom Ellison acquired a letter of marque on 20 March 1799.

1st slave voyage (1800–1801): Captain Caesar Lawson acquired a letter of marque on 26 May 1800. He sailed on 24 June. He acquired slaves at Bonny and arrived at Dominica on 24 November with 289. Nelly sailed from Dominica on 7 February 1801 and arrived back at Liverpool on 21 March. She had left Liverpool with 41 crew members and had suffered six crew deaths on her voyage.

2nd slave voyage (1802–1803): Captain John Lawson sailed from Liverpool on 14 January 1802. When he sailed the Peace of Amiens was about to take effect and so he did not acquire a letter of marque. He acquired slaves at Badagry, stopped at São Tomé, and arrived at Demerara on 9 October with 283 slaves. Nelly sailed from Demerara on 3 December and arrived back at Liverpool on 12 February 1802. She had left Liverpool with 30 crew members and had suffered six crew deaths on her voyage.

3rd slave voyage (1805–loss): Captain James Seldon acquired a letter of marque on 14 March 1805. He sailed on 28 April 1805 and gathered slaves at Ambriz.

==Fate==

In December 1805, Lloyd's List reported that , Hensley, master, and Nelly, Selden, master, had been captured at Angola. They were among the seven vessels off the Congo River that had fallen prey to a privateer. The privateer was described as being of 22 guns and 350 men. Nelly's captor sent her to the River Plate.

A second report named the captors as L'Orient, of 14 guns, and Dromedario, of 22 guns. The captured vessels arrived in the River Plate before 12 November. Nelly arrived at Montevideo with 19 enslaved people; she had only embarked 20 before the Spanish captured her. She had left Liverpool with 50 crew members and arrived at Montevideo with 51, although she had suffered 10 crew member deaths on her voyage.

Spanish records report that in June 1805, Viceroy Sobremonte, of Argentina, issued two letters of marque, one for Dolores (24 guns), Currand, master, and Berro y Errasquin, owner, and one for Dromedario (20 guns), Hippolito Mordel, master, and Canuerso y Masini, owner. The two sailed for the African coast, looking to capture enslaving ships. In three months of cruising Dolores captured three ships and one brig, carrying a total 600 enslaved people. Dromedario captured five ships, carrying a total of 500 enslaved people.

In 1805, 30 British slave ships were lost. Thirteen were lost on the coast of Africa. During the period 1793 to 1807, war, rather than maritime hazards or slave resistance, was the greatest cause of vessel losses among British slave vessels.

Rurouni Kenshin is a Japanese anime television series, based on the manga series of the same title by Nobuhiro Watsuki. It is the second anime television series adaptation, after the 1996–98 series. It is directed by Hideyo Yamamoto and animated by Liden Films. It premiered in July 2023 on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block.

==Premise==

In the Meiji era in Japan, Himura Kenshin is a pacifist wanderer who is visiting Tokyo. He helps people in need with his skills in swordsmanship. He had previously used these skills during the Bakumatsu, when he earned the title of Hitokiri Battosai from Ishin Shishi. 

Kenshin is requested by Kamiya Kaoru, the current owner of the Kamiya Kasshin Ryu dojo, to help her with defending her area. Apparently a criminal started making mayhem in the area, while using Kenshin's title.

==Voice cast==

==Production==

On December 19, 2021, at the Jump Festa '22 event, it was announced that a new television series adaptation of the Rurouni Kenshin manga would be animated by Liden Films. A promotional video was shown at the Aniplex Online Fest 2022 on September 24, 2022. The series will re-adapt the original manga series. It is directed by Hideyo Yamamoto, with scripts written by Hideyuki Kurata, character designs by Terumi Nishii, and music composed by Yū Takami. The original manga author, Nobuhiro Watsuki, supervised the character designs and scenario.

Yamamoto said that he used to watch all Rurouni Kenshin works during his youth, and was in particular impressed by the original video animations for it different artwork. He came think the main appeal of the series was how the series showed people's lives in the Meiji Era and how Kenshin not only fought enemies but also helped them redeem from their crimes while interacting with them. The latter was further noted to make Kenshin as a man every viewer wants to be like. From the beginning, he was thinking that he wanted to show "a way of foreshadowing" but wanted the details to be subtle, similar to the dramas that often air next to Kenshin. In contrast to the more comical original work, Yamamoto aimed to make the narrative more serious and avoid slapstick or superdeformed designs in order to make it more realistic. In animating the work, they used 3DCG with 3-D models of the rooms a fitting for the modern age. Horse carriages were animated through CGI as they were a common vehicle used in the Meiji. In regards to the action, the animation was given a more unique style for fight scene when Tokyo. The designs were made by Terumi Nishii under supervision by Yamamoto and Watsuki. Careful detail was given to the kimono and other clothing featured in the anime. 

Among many supervisions of the series, Kaoru Kurosaki and Watsuki aimed to make it fitting for the Reiwa era as well as accessible to both newcomers and returning audience. The story arc involving Raijuta was revised in order to improved in the 2023 anime. Kurosaki in particular revised the scripts of the Raijuta episodes. Kurata came up with new ideas to revisit Sanosuke's backstory in order to bring further depth to the character. Meetings were done in order to supervise most episodes. While the clothing remained the same, the way bodies are drawn were revised due to improvements from the graphic style from the manga and 1990s version. Soma Saito was chosen because the staff found him fitting to portray both the gentle and rude demeanors of Kenshin. After the musical based on the manga was done, the staff found the manga very comical and wanted to generate different style with the new anime, to the point Kenshin no longer says his expression of "Oro?" meant to sound as comic relief to his reactions in jokes. Nevertheless, there was still a desire to keep some comical scenes.

Kenshin's voice actor, Soma Saito, said he was a fan of the series ever since he was a child and looks forward to creating his own take of Kenshin. Meanwhile, Kaoru's voice actress, Rie Takahashi, was surprised she was selected to voice the heroine and, similar to Saito, wanted to create an appealing version of Karou. Among other main actors include Makoto Koichi who aims to portray Yahiko's high spirits while Taku Yashiro aims to adapt various side of Sanosuke's personality such as his youth and rough attitude.

==Release==

The series premiered on July 7, 2023, on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block. It will run for two consecutive cours of 24 episodes. Ayase and R-Shitei (under the name Ayase×R-Shitei) performed the opening theme "Hiten", while Reol performed the ending theme "Kissaki". The episodes will be collected by Aniplex on eight DVDs and Blu-ray sets, set to be released from October 25, 2023, to May 29, 2024.

[[Aernoult–Rousset affair]]

CATEGORIES: 1909 in France, 1909 in military history, 1909 deaths, Anarchism in France, French Algeria, Political scandals in France, 1909 in Algeria

In the Aernoult–Rousset affair, the French Left organized to protest France's North African military prisons and expatriate the body of a conscript who died there in 1909. While the military classified Albert Aernoult's death as a stroke, the witness Émile Rousset claimed that it had been assault by their commanding officers. After the Chamber of Deputies backed the military's account and a war council sentenced Rousset to prison for insubordination, French socialists began to organize to repatriate Aernoult's corpse, free Rousset, and close the Algerian military prisons. The affair demonstrated how the French antimilitarist Left, normally prone to infighting, could unify.

==Death of Aernoult==

Albert Aernoult was a poor laborer from Romainville, east of Paris. After participating in a local road workers strike, he spent ten months in jail. Councillor of State Pierre Gilbert de Voisins convinced him to join the French army, but Aernoult did not know this meant the African battalion. Aernoult, unhappy and rebellious, was transferred to a disciplinary unit.

He died in Algeria on July 2, 1909, two years after his arrest. Though his parents had recently received a letter from Aernoult that mentioned his fine health, the official military letter following his death claimed that Aernoult had gone into a rage that day and had a stroke. Émile Rousset, who served in Aernoult's military unit, claimed otherwise. He said he saw Aernoult's commanding officers beat him to death. Rousset spoke out and was imprisoned for his disobedience. He wrote letters to Aernoult's parents and Parisian journals. Le Matin covered the story and by mid-November, so had L'Humanité and La Guerre Sociale.

In mid-November, socialist deputy Jean Allemane interpellated France's war minister on Aernoult's cause of death. The minister's subsequent inquiry, a formality, maintained the cause as stroke. Deputy Adrien Veber read the chamber a letter on from 15 members of Aernoult's unit attributing the cause of death to their commanding officers. This did not sway the Chamber of Deputies, who voted overwhelmingly to close the interpellation.

==Escalation==

Rousset continued to speak out about Aernoult's death with the backing of antimilitarists. He was invited to speak with the Oran war council on the pretense of sharing his account of Aernoult's death, but ultimately to be tried for insubordination and sentenced to five years in prison, on February 2, 1910. Socialists at the Nîmes Congress swiftly responded with a motion denouncing the sentence and plans for a new probe. The cause ignited the French Left—socialists, anarchists, and syndicalists alike—who held meetings, postered, and protested. Their threefold aims were to repatriate Aernoult's corpse, free Rousset, and close the Algerian military prisons. L'Humanité began a fund to exhume and return Aernoult's body to France, as his parents wanted.

The next month, a "down with Biribi" poster campaign, using the pejorative term for the North African military and its prisons, proved successful. The Comité de Défense Sociale (CDS) created the poster, having been formed from anarchist groups in 1905. Its 16 signers contended that Rousset's sentence was a crime to cover up the crime of Aernoult's death, and encouraged soldiers to desert and kill their officers. They were acquitted in their subsequent trial, arguing that revolutionary action was ethical when legal action did not solve the issue of military prisons. Their trial was aided by an autopsy of Aernoult, which found external physical violence to Aernoult's corpse, corroborating Rousset's story. The French Left was morally embolded by the trial to act against the military prisons. La Voix du Peuple and La Guerre Sociale each published on the affair in July, and a group organized by Émile Aubin stirred popular opinion again with their "decorated murderers" poster in September.

==Legacy==

The affair demonstrated how the French antimilitarist Left, normally prone to infighting, could unify for a cause, namely the repatriation of Aernoult's corpse and a protest against military prisons.

[[School of the Arts (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2007 debut albums, Jazz fusion albums by American artists

School of the Arts is the debut album by the group of the same name, founded and led by keyboardist T Lavitz. It was recorded in 2007, and was released later that year by Magnatude Records. On the album, which was the group's sole release, and which features mostly acoustic instruments, Lavitz is joined by guitarists Frank Gambale and Steve Morse, violinist Jerry Goodman, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Dave Weckl.

==Reception==

A reviewer for AllMusic wrote that the group "throws everything into the pot: jazz, rock, blues, country, Latin, and classical, but this wide-ranging eclecticism works remarkably well... While there's no shortage of chops... there's also an impressive interplay and sympathy, making School of the Arts a fusion lover's dream come true."

John Kelman of All About Jazz stated: "the pianist is the real revelation here. His cohorts' reputations are all well-established, but with School of the Arts Lavitz finally emerges as an inventive writer, pianist and bandleader. Hopefully there'll be more to come." AAJ's Ian Patterson commented: "Lavitz, in stellar company, has produced something of a rarity; an acoustic album with the vitality of electric fusion, and feel-good tunes which are a celebration of the joy of playing."

Bill Meredith, writing for Jazz Times, remarked: "Lavitz seemed to realize that an electric fusion outing by this cast would be deemed predictable, so outside of the occasional electric violin by Jerry Goodman and bass by John Patitucci, he went all acoustic. That element of surprise, and musical chemistry... make for inspired playing."

In an article for Contemporary Jazz, John Hilderbrand wrote: "School of the Arts is Lavitz's most straight ahead recording since 1991's Mood Swings, and in my opinion, his strongest session in a long time... In a year of some very interesting and good recordings, this may be my #1 pick. If you like your jazz cerebral and muscular, then School of the Arts is a keeper."

Writing for Sea of Tranquility, Michael Popke stated: "these extraordinary players are given room to stretch – although none of them steals the spotlight. In fact, this happens to be a complete collaborative effort that often sounds improvised, and the musical interplay makes it seem as if these guys have been playing together their whole lives."

[[Armand Matha]]

CATEGORIES: 1861 births, 1930 deaths, French anarchists, People from Paris, People from Draveil, French hairdressers

Louis Armand Matha (1861–1930) was a French anarchist involved in multiple Parisian newspapers, including over a decade as the manager of Le Libertaire.

==Life==

Louis Armand Matha was born April 10, 1861, in Casteljaloux, France. His parents were Bonapartists. He did not attend school and taught himself to read. Matha was, in turns, a Gambettist, a Blanquist, and an anarchist. He became a hairdresser, whereupon he met Sébastien Faure in 1887, prior to his fame. The pair traveled together.

Matha began work in Paris in 1891, assisting in Jean Grave's La Révolte and managing several other publications. He served a prison sentence for "incitement to murder" in 1892. Matha lived in London in 1893 to avoid repression. He was involved with Émile Henry and knew in advance of his attack. Matha was arrested following an April 1894 explosion at the Foyot restaurant but ultimately was not connected to the event. He was named and acquitted in the August 1894 Trial of the Thirty.

He participated in the founding of Faure's Le Libertaire in 1895 and managed its activities through 1911, during which time he lived in relative poverty. He was sentenced to prison for 20 days in 1896 in relation to his role with the paper. Matha also joined Faure in founding Le Journal du peuple in 1899, which Matha also ran before managing the monthly Les Hommes de Révolution through mid-1900. During the Dreyfus affair, Matha was an ardent Dreyfusard. He also helped to organize Louise Michel's funeral.

In what was later known as the "Matha affair", the French police attempted to link Le Libertaire with a group of counterfeiters in 1907 after having found a single box of counterfeiting material stored in the publication's offices. Matha and four others were charged. The advocate general withdrew the case against Matha for poor evidence but two from the group were ultimately sentenced and fined. Matha was acquitted in a 1910 trial for incitement to murder and disobedience after he signed a poster for justice in the Aernoult–Rousset affair.

In 1911, Matha lived with Laurentine Sauvraz in Paris. They operated a neo-Malthusian bookstore and sold contraceptives.

During World War I, Matha enlisted as a military nurse but ultimately turned towards pacifism. After the war, he moved with Sauvraz to Draveil where he was active in the school and activities for children.

Matha died on February 12, 1930, in Draveil. He was buried in Père-Lachaise Cemetery.

[[Beith Townhouse]]

Beith Townhouse is a municipal building in The Strand, Beith, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The structure, which is currently used as an information and heritage centre, is a Category B listed building.

==History==

The first municipal building in Beith was a tolbooth in The Strand which was completed in 1636. It accommodated prison cells on the ground floor and the parish school on the first floor. Both the prisoners and the schoolchildren were transferred to Braehead in 1768 and the building was subsequently used as stabling for the horses of customers staying at the Saracen's Head Hotel. By the early 19th century, the tolbooth was in such a dilapidated state that a group of local merchants led by William Wilson decided to raise money by public subscription with a view to erecting a new building on the same site.

The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 22 May 1817. It was designed by William Dobie in the neoclassical style, built in painted ashlar sandstone and was completed later that year. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto The Strand. The ground floor featured a segmental headed doorway with a fanlight, flanked by a pair of segmental headed windows, while the first floor was fenestrated by three square headed sash windows. Pilasters were erected at the edges of the outer bays to support a pediment with a coat of arms in the tympanum. At roof level, there was a central bellcote with a ogive-shaped roof and a weather vane. Internally, the principal room on the first floor was the assembly hall, while the ground floor accommodated two shops, one of which was let as an ironmonger's shop from 1862 until the end of the century. There was a prison cell for incarcerating petty criminals under the stairs.

A bell for the bellcote was donated by George Sheddon, a partner in the firm of the trading firm of Robert Sheddon & Sons: it was cast by Thomas Mears of Whitechapel Bell Foundry and installed in the bellcote in 1823. The building remained in the ownership of the subscribers and was managed a committee of magistrates and local gentry until 1838.

The building subsequently fell under the management of the local parish council. However, following the re-organisation of local government in 1975, the building came into the ownership of the newly-formed Cunninghame District Council which used it as offices for the delivery of local services. That use ceased in the late 1980s and the building fell vacant for the remainder of the 20th century. In the early 21st century, it was used as temporary offices for local businesses undergoing refurbishment. Following the introduction of unitary authorities in 1996, ownership passed to North Ayrshire Council. The Beith Cultural and Heritage Society, a charity founded in 2006, took a lease on the building from North Ayrshire Council in 2010. After completion of an extensive programme of refurbishment works, the ground floor of the building was re-opened as an information and heritage centre in April 2011. Further works to make to building fully watertight were then completed in 2014.

The Ripon Obelisk is an obelisk monument in the centre of the Yorkshire settlement of Ripon in Northern England. It was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and constructed in 1702 with the support of John Aislabie, Ripon's Member of Parliament. It has been granted Grade I status and was first listed in 1949. It is located in the market square of Ripon, one of the smallest settlements in England to have city status. It stands at around eighty feet in height.

Hawksmoor may have been inspired by recent discoveries that Ripon might have originally been a Roman town. In his 1724 book A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain Daniel Defoe notes "In the middle of it stands a curious column of stone, imitating the obelisks of the ancients, though not so high, but rather like the pillar in the middle of Covent Garden, or that in Lincoln's Inn".

In 1781 the monument was restored by William Aislabie, the son of the obelisk's founder and himself a long-standing MP to celebrate his sixty years in Parliament. At this point a weathervane was added in the style of the Ripon hornblower. A plaque was added soon afterwards, which misleadingly implies that William was the builder of the monument.

France Forever (France Quand Même) was an organization founded on June 29, 1940 as an association of French men and women living in the United States, as well as American friends of France, acting to preserve comradeship between these countries in the cause of freedom and democracy. 

The organisation was created to support Général de Gaulle fight the Nazi occupation, and Vichy France. It aimed to represent de Gaulle in the United States and to acquire embassy status. It also declared to: "Assist the United States in all measures of preparedness to meet the menace to democratic institutions." In 1941, the France Forever association had forty-six sections.

Its headquarters was located on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, NYC.

==Founders & action==

Founders:

Houdry was its first President.

Founded in his apartment.

The organisation became affiliated with the French Committee of National Liberation and published a monthly bulletin promoting its ideas, fighting against Nazi propaganda and having the voice of France to be heard in the United States as well as encouraging those in France to resist and play their part in bringing about ultimate victory.

Michel Wibault, De Gaulle appointed him as technical director of France Forever. On 17 June 1940 Wibault escaped with his wife Marie-Rose from Paris to London.

Wibault was one of its "most active men."

Fred G. Hoffherr cabled de Gaulle, "Command, we shall obey . ... Vive la France!" 

Next day, Eugene Houdry cabled him (referring to the French people): "They are entirely at your orders."

Following Charles de Gaulle's appeal on 18 June 1940, on 29 June, Dr Albert Simard, who was president of the French Veterans of the Great War, and also of the Associated French Societies of New York, had called a public meeting to launch a support movement.

Clarendon was launched in France in 1788, under another name. She was taken in prize in 1804. In 1805, Clarendon began a voyage as a slave ship in the triangular trade in enslaved people but fell prey to Spanish privateers after she had embarked slaves.

==Career==

Clarendon first appeared in Lloyd's Register in 1805.

Captain William Grice acquired a letter of marque on 7 January 1805. He sailed from Liverpool on 23 January. He acquired slaves at the Congo River and Cabinda.

==Fate==

In December 1805, Lloyd's List reported that Clarendon, , Mills, master, and , Thompson, master, had been captured at Angola on 1 September. They were among the seven vessels off the Congo River that had fallen prey to a privateer. The privateer was described as being of 22 guns and 350 men. Clarendon's captor sent her to the River Plate.

A second report named the captors as L'Orient, of 14 guns, and Dromedario, of 22 guns. The captured vessels arrived in the River Plate before 12 November. Clarendon arrived at Montevideo on 27 October 1805, with 232 slaves.

Spanish records report that in June 1805, Viceroy Sobremonte, of Argentina, issued two letters of marque, one for Dolores (24 guns), Currand, master, and Berro y Errasquin, owner, and one for Dromedario (20 guns), Hippolito Mordel, master, and Canuerso y Masini, owner. The two sailed for the African coast, looking to capture enslaving ships. In three months of cruising Dolores captured three ships and one brig, carrying a total 600 enslaved people. Dromedario captured five ships, carrying a total of 500 enslaved people.

In 1805, 30 British slave ships were lost. Thirteen were lost on the coast of Africa. During the period 1793 to 1807, war, rather than maritime hazards or slave resistance, was the greatest cause of vessel losses among British slave vessels.

[[Richard Grissom]]

Richard Anthony Grissom Jr. (born November 10, 1960) is an American serial killer who murdered three young women in Johnson County, Kansas, over eight days in June 1989. Having been imprisoned years earlier for killing his neighbor, Grissom disposed his victims' bodies and they have never been found to date. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1990.

==Early life==

Richard Anthony Grissom Jr. was born on an American military installation in South Korea, the son of a US army Sergeant and a South Korean woman, on November 10, 1960. Its unknown what his original name was, but soon after his birth his family gave him up to an orphanage, where three years later he was adopted by US army Sergeant Richard Grissom Sr. and his wife Fredonia. Afterwards the family moved to the United States. Even there, his new family moved across numerous states before finally settling in Kansas state. Details of his childhood are not exactly known, but after his family moved to Leavenworth in the mid-1970s, Grissom enrolled at Leavenworth High School, where he gained popularity as a friendly, good looking, and smart kid who regularly got As and Bs and was a halfback for his school's football team.

==Murder of Hazel Meeker==

On the morning of January 27, 1977, Grissom left his home after an argument with his parents. Sometime after leaving, he stole a railroad spike, which he used to break into the home of his neighbor, 72-year-old Hazel Meeker. In the house he attacked Meeker, viciously beating her until her death, then left the house. Meeker's granddaughter, Carla, went to visit her grandmother, but found her dead body in a pool of blood. She contacted the police who showed up and conducted an investigation. Police discovered that there were footprints in the snow all around the house, and they subsequently followed the trail which led them to the southern railroad tracks. They continued to follow them until they ended right where Grissom was hiding in a trailer park. When they noticed him, Grissom attempted to bury a handgun he had stolen from another home under the snow, but police handcuffed him before he could.

In police custody, Grissom confessed to the murder and added that he had lost one of his shoes in the creek while running from the home. Police later went back to the area but could not locate it, but took his word as when he was arrested, he was only wearing one shoe. In April 1977 Grissom, since he was 16 years old, was convicted under a juvenile court and was sent to be housed at a Boys Industrial Center in Topeka. In February 1979, Grissom and two other juveniles escaped from the center and were on the run for about a day. During this time they broke into a home in Jefferson County. They were recaptured without resentence, with the superintendent of the youth center filing a juvenile delinquency charge against Grissom.

===Release and later years===

Grissom was released in 1980, and soon after enrolled at Kansas State University. In September Grissom traveled to Manhattan where he applied for the track team. During practice he garnered the nickname "rock man" for the fact that he would fall on almost every jump. By October Grissom quit the track team and instead took up racquetball, where he was regarded as a star competitor. He also took up a job at Arby's. The following year he joined the softball team. In 1982 Grissom was listed in the student directory as a sophomore studying architecture. In November 1982, a month before the final exams, Grissom stole $190 from a Manhattan resume service. He was arrested in January 1983, and two months later pleaded no contest to a theft charge was given a suspended sentence and was placed on a three-year probation. Afterwards Grissom drifted between Kansas City and Manhattan. In 1984 Grissom stole a Mazda RX-7, for which he was sentenced to serve time in prison. In June 1988 he was paroled.

==Johnson County disappearances==

On June 8, 1989, Grissom, who presented himself as Randy Rodriguez, rented a storage locker in southern Johnson County, which was to remain his until July 1. Afterwards, in just over a week's span, three young women all in their early twenties went missing in Johnson County. The first of these cases was 24-year-old Joan Marie Butler of Overland Park. On June 18, she visited a friend's house in Kansas City on the Country Club Plaza. That was last time anyone heard from her, as when she failed to show up for work the following day she was reported missing. On June 25, her rental car was spotted at an apartment complex with witnesses recalling seeing a man fleeing the car. In the car police located a single blood stain. The following day two roommates, Theresa Brown and Christine Rusch, both 22, hosted a party which was meant to be a farewell to Brown as she was moving out. The next day, when the two did not show up for work, they were reported missing.

===Investigation and arrest===

Police were able to pinpoint Grissom as a suspect after he was identified as a person spotted on surveillance cameras using Butler's bank card. Since police had no evidence of a kidnapping, authorities charged Grissom with one count of theft, but since he had not yet been located, police alerted the public. At the same time, friends of Brown and Rusch saw Grissom's photo and identified him as a man who attended Brown's going away party. Detectives learned that on the same day Brown and Rusch disappeared Grissom rented a second storage locker along with a woman identifying herself as Brown in Stanley. Approximately a couple hours later bank surveillance captured Rusch on video withdrawing money from an ATM.

In late June, law enforcement received a warrant to inspect Grissom's car, a brown Toyota, which was found to be holding Brown and Rusch's credit cards, along with a 12-inch, red stained knife. Additionally witnesses who lived near Butler's apartment said they had seen a car similar to Grissom's parked outside of the apartment building in the days after the murder. This same vehicle was also spotted at the scene of an attempted abduction on June 12, in which case a woman named Michelle Katf was attacked in her bedroom by a man welding a gun. After a struggle between Katf and the man, the man fled and sped off in the vehicle, according to a witness named Thomas Haynes. Police searched through both of Grissom's storage lockers and collected numerous strands of hair on the floors. The hair strands were submitted to the Johnson County crime lab who compared the strands to hair collected from the women's hairbrushes, and the lab found a high probability the hairs found in the lockers belonged to the women. Finally, in the homes of Brown and Rusch police uncovered strands of male pubic hair, which contained DNA, and when it was compared to a DNA sample of Grissom, they were a match.

In early July, the FBI located Grissom hiding out in Texas, and 15 federal agents were dispatched there to arrest him. On July 7, they staked out an American Airlines terminal in Dallas for about 4 1⁄2 hours. At 9:45 a.m., they spotted Grissom and arrested him without incident. Grissom was then led to an interrogation room, where for about eight hours he was questioned by FBI agent Mike Napier and Leawood Police Detective Joe Langer, who pressed him about the incriminating evidence. According to both, Grissom, who did not confess nor deny abducting the women, stated he wanted a deal that could, according to him, "provide the whole package", and also request an attorney. It was found that he had been staying at a motel in Corpus Christi, and authorities searched through it, though no new evidence was found.

In late July, the KCTV news station in Kansas City, Missouri was sent an anonymous two-page letter, which offered to release the three women, whom the writer claimed were being held against their will, for an exchange of $1,500,000. The origins of the letter were investigated, and it contained a Chillicothe, Missouri postmark and a Brookfield, Missouri return address. David Burger of the Lenexa Police Department stated that the letter, "didn't attach any credence", and there was, "no validation to the demands". The writer was identified as 21-year-old Gary Lewis of Chillicothe. Johnson County investigators determined that Lewis was not holding the women against their will, did not have any connection with Grissom, nor was he connected to the case. Lewis admitted to writing the letter and was charged in court with attempted theft and falsely reporting a crime. Lewis said that he merely wrote the letter as a way to gain attention. In exchange for dropping the attempted theft charge, Lewis pleaded guilty to falsely reporting a crime, and judge Gerald Hougland imposed a maximum sentence of one year in prison and ordering Lewis to pay $1,500.

Despite that no trace of the women had yet been found, authorities had enough evidence to suggest that all three had been killed, and charged Grissom with three counts of first-degree murder, one count of aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated robbery, two counts of aggravated burglary, one count of burglary and one count of theft. Grissom remained in a Dallas jail to await extradition to Kansas, however he attempted to fight his extradition and it would not be until November that he returned to Kansas.

==Aftermath==

In March 1990, judge Robert Jones lowered Grissom's robbery charges from four counts of aggravated robbery to four counts of simple robbery. On March 14, Grissom entered a not guilty plea to the charges. He went to trial in November. The bodies of the three women were yet to be found, but on November 3, 1990, Grissom was found guilty of all charges. He was therefore sentenced to life in prison. The women's bodies have never been recovered, and Grissom has refused to offer information. He has also refused to offer information about the unsolved June 7, 1989 murder of 25-year-old Terri Renee Maness, a woman he had once dated.

Grissom's case was brought up during the 1990 Kansas gubernatorial election, when Republican governor Mike Hayden, who was seeking re-election, used the case as an example as to why capital punishment should be reinstated in Kansas. Hayden argued that if Grissom had been sentenced to death for the 1977 murder, then he would not have been able to kill the other three women. This sparked controversy as a lot of people, including former governor John William Carlin, pointed out that Grissom could not have received the death penalty at the time because he was a juvenile. Hayden would lose the election to Democratic opponent Joan Finney, but capital punishment was later reinstated in Kansas in 1994. In 1998 it was discovered that Grissom had joined an internet pen pal group dedicated to those incarcerated. Family members of his victims expressed their disappointment that such a website was allowed; Tim Butler, who was the brother of Joan Butler, wrote to the web site operators and said, "the monster Grissom forgot to mention his other hobbies: bludgeoning old ladies with railroad spikes and killing and torturing young women."

In August 1999, a team of searches from NecroSearch inc. scoured a landfill near Clinton Lake after theories about the women's bodies being buried there emerged. However, the search turned up no results. In 2010 The Wichita Eagle daily newspaper erroneously wished a happy birthday to Grissom, who had turned 50. This was seen by many as inappropriate, but the newspaper agency responded by explaining that they received no info about Grissom's background prior to the paper's publishing and that they had been a victim of a prank. In 2017, Grissom was accused of passing a sexually explicit note to a female corrections officer. While Grisson admitted to passing the note, he claimed the woman wanted him to. She denied it, and Grissom was to spend 30 days in segregation. As of year, Grissom is currently imprisoned at El Dorado Correctional Facility. He will not be eligible for parole until 2093.

She has also served as the local spokeswoman on health, child care and labour issues for the SD. For the 2022 Swedish general election, she was selected by the SD to lead the party's Riksdag candidate list for the Halland county electoral list. During her campaign, she focused on increasing the number of police officers in the constituency and for changes to Sweden's asylum system, arguing that aid should be given to refugee camps near war zones rather than maintaining a policy which she claims encourages refugees to migrate illegally to Sweden. Boulwén was subsequently elected to the Riksdag, taking a seat from the Left Party.

[[Webster Marble]]

CATEGORIES: 1854 births, 1930 deaths, 20th-century inventors, American inventors, American businesspeople, People from Delta County, Michigan

Webster L. Marble (1854–1930) was an inventor, early outdoorsman, and prolific patent-holder who spent the majority of his life in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. His manufacturing company, now known as simply as Marble Arms, has operated in the town of Gladstone, Michigan since 1898.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Webster Lansing Marble was born on March 23, 1854, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the third of six children born to Mary Chipman Marble and her husband Lansing Marble, a trapper and basketmaker. The family moved to Vassar, Michigan in 1858, where they would live until Webster was 15. He spent the majority of his childhood outdoors: hunting, fishing, and trapping alongside his siblings. Webster's family moved again in 1868, this time to Frankfort, Michigan, where his parents would remain for the rest of their lives. His father, Lansing Marble, operated a bushel basket-making business that used proprietary machines to increase stave basket-making capacity from one-a-day to over one hundred. He owned a basket factory back in Milwaukee from 1863 until 1867, when he sold the business to devote more time to the outdoor interests he shared with his son. It has been said that his both his father's entrepreneurial spirit and his passion for the outdoors likely heavily influenced Webster. 

===Timber cruiser===

For two decades, Webster Marble worked as a timber cruiser and surveyor throughout Northern Michigan's white pine forests. Timber cruisers played a vital role in the logging industry, traveling ahead alone to hike into the forests, take measurements, and report data back to the lumber companies for months at a time. During his time as a cruiser the Upper Peninsula was largely unsettled, viewed primarily as a deposit of resources like copper, iron, and lumber rather than a residential location. Demand for wood in the area had skyrocketed following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, providing Webster with more than enough work for many years.

Marble gained notoriety amongst his fellow cruisers for his uncanny ability to calculate the amount of useable lumber produced from a given acreage of forest just by looking at it. Not known for being a large man, Webster had to carry more than 50 pounds of heavy cruising and surveying equipment through the woods every day, including a large, razor-sharp hatchet. When his fellow surveyors settled down at the fire after a long day's work, Webster was known for pulling out his sketchbook and working on ideas for new tools that could improve work in the woods. Memories of this time did not escape him in his later years, as he would eventually invent numerous products that made his previous career significantly easier for those now employed in the timber industry.  

Webster married Rosa M. Derry, a former resident of New York, in Frankfort, Michigan in 1878. The pair would have two sons, William Lansing (1880–1977) and Floyd Webster (1891–1937).

===Gladstone===

Webster Marble moved to Gladstone, Michigan with his wife and young son William right when the town was forming in 1887, after learning about the area's industrial and natural potential. Noting the Soo Line Railroad and nearby Little Bay de Noc, Marble decided to join several other industrial businesses in staking a claim in the town. In 1889, his then-86-year-old father died in his home while on a visit from Frankfort. The following year Webster founded the Gladstone Exchange Bank and served as its president for the next four decades. Webster began manufacturing gunsights in his small garage workshop at approximately the same time, patenting his first invention in 1891. Webster and Rosa's second son, Floyd, was born in Gladstone the same year.

Webster became heavily involved in the local Gladstone community as it began to form, joining both the local Republican Party and the Gladstone branch of the Freemasons, and winning a seat on the Gladstone School board. He also became heavily involved in the local Episcopal church, serving on the church board for many years as a treasurer and trustee. Marble's wife Rosa died in 1923, and he married her younger sister Eunice Derry a year later in 1924.  

Webster L. Marble died on September 22, 1930, and was buried on the Protestant side of Fernwood Cemetery, one of the Gladstone's earliest cemeteries.

Upon his death, control of Marble Arms went to his son William Marble, while his second son Floyd Marble inherited the Gladstone Exchange Bank. 

==Marble Arms and Manufacturing Co.==

At the beginning of the 20th-century, Americans began to view the outdoors as more than just a place to source resources. Until the early 1900s, fishing, hunting, camping, and other outdoor activities were done to survive, not have fun. Webster Marble, an avid outdoorsman who had grown up trapping, fishing, and hunting alongside his father, sensed the public's rapidly growing interest in the outdoors and jumped to capitalize on it. Marble was an inventor who believed that a person only needed four simple items to be safe in the woods: a waterproof compass that secured to your clothes, a sturdy hatchet, a well-designed knife and a waterproof matchbox. 

===History===

In the early 1890s, Webster Marble created the first Marble Universal Gunsight from his garage in Gladstone, patenting his invention under the name Gladstone Manufacturing Company. The gunsight would eventually be manufactured in 37 sizes to accommodate a number of popular gun models, including those made by Winchester, Marlin, Remington and Colt, though the Financial Panic of 1893 delayed their wider release (and thus the start of the company) by over a decade.

Marble continued working on his inventions in his garage at odd hours, while returning to timber cruising to support his family, until 1898. He had a brand-new invention that gave his company a new name, the Marble Safety Axe Company, so he extended his workshop to include 640 sq. ft. of floor space. For a year, the company would only produce the Marble Safety Axe – until the wealthy founder of Gladstone itself, Frank H. Van Cleve, became a partner in the business. In 1900, with investments from Van Cleve and a second nearby financier named James T. Jones, Marble Safety Axe Co. moved to a 24,000 sq. ft. factory that was lauded as the largest of its kind in the world. The company's name would undergo several more changes, but it would remain at this location until more than three decades after Webster Marble's death.

===Marketing===

Webster Marble used many advertising techniques that are still popular today, as he had an early understanding of the importance of marketing in retail. In the early 1900s, Webster sent boxes of his merchandise to stores across the United States that he thought might be suited to carry his products. He even included a packet of instructions on the best way to display Marble products in every package. In 1899, Webster travelled to New York City to showcase his products at the national Sports Expo at Madison Square Garden. At the height of his marketing ideas, Marble distributed more than 1 million copies of Marble's Message monthly magazine, and his advertising had been seen by more than 20 million people by 1912. He sent his marketing materials to more than 50 national outdoors magazines, changing his address slightly each time so he could chart how much each magazine had helped his sales just by looking at the envelopes of the orders. This allowed him to funnel more of his advertising budget towards running ads in the exact national magazines that generated the most revenue for his company.

In 1905, Webster Marble tried celebrity endorsements and hired trick shooter and expert marksman Captain Jack O'Connell to serve as head of Marble's Sighting Department. If a customer purchased a Marble gunsight, they could have it professionally installed and sighted by Captain O'Connell for merely the cost of ammunition. If you didn't purchase your gunsight from Marble but still wanted to see the Captain, you could use the service by paying a $1 fee to the company. Captain Jack O'Connell was the only real person ever pictured in a Marble's advertisement.

===Legacy===

For more than 125 years, the company that Webster Marble founded has outfitted fishermen, soldiers, scouts, hunters, and campers with reliable tools for the outdoors. The present Marble Arms manufacturing facility was built in 1966 in Gladstone and is still in operation today. As of 2022, Marble Arms employs dozens of workers who primarily manufacture Marble gunsights that are distributed by an exclusive number of firearms businesses in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany. Two successful Delta County businesses, Bark River Knives and Rapid River Knifeworks, were founded by former Marble Arms employees in the early 2000s.

In 1966, a man in Iowa named Dennis Hoegh invented a vacuum-formed plastic, hard-shell gun case. Hoegh soon made a deal with Marble Arms that included a generous relocation package, opening a brand new vacuum-formed plastic factory in Gladstone later that year. Marble's deal ended soon after, leaving Hoegh with a factory full of expensive machinery specifically built for manufacturing small plastic boxes. In 1971 Hoegh received a $50,000 small business loan and used it to create the world's first pet casket manufacturing company. The Hoegh Pet Casket factory remained in Gladstone as the world leader in pet casket production for decades, generating a reported $5 million a year in revenue. The company was purchased and rebranded to simply Hoegh Caskets in 2019 as a sign of respect and acknowledgement of the human need for such products.

==Notable inventions==

Over the course of his lifetime, Webster Marble registered official patents for more than 60 of his best inventions. Today, Marble Arms is largely known for producing quality all-steel gunsights, though they were best known for crafting hunting knives, safety axes, fishing gaffs, match safes, and waterproof compasses during Webster's time. Webster Marble's inventions set the standard for outdoor tools in the 20th-century, with many of them still in use by people looking to safely enjoy the outdoors today. 

===Marble Safety Axe===

During his decades working in the woods as a timber cruiser, Marble saw an unfortunate number of men become severely injured by the exposed, razor-sharp edge of their axe blade. One of Marble's first major inventions, the Marble Safety Axe No. 3 featured an attached blade cover that folded into the handle when the axe was in use. Webster's company was renamed the Marble Safety Axe Company by the time his patent for the safety axe was approved in 1898. After finding success with their first safety axe, Marble Safety Axe Co. produced 11 different models from 1911 until the mid-1970s. 

===Hunting knives===

Prior to Marble's inventions, the only knives available for outdoorsmen were either flimsy kitchen-style knives or Bowie-style fighting knives. The Marble Ideal knife introduced in 1900 was built for the outdoors, featuring a sturdy handle that made it practical to use for a host of tasks and reliable enough to be easily carried by anyone. The Ideal could be customized by the purchaser, with options available for the handle, guards and sheaths, and blade lengths ranging from 4–8 inches. The larger Marble Woodcraft knife was introduced in 1915 as the choice knife for hunters and trappers, with the Boy Scouts of America endorsing it as the official knife of the Boy Scouts from 1933 to 1940. The small Marble Sport knife of the late 1920s became the official knife of the Girl Scouts of America, with the Boy Scouts authorizing it as a cheaper alternative to the Woodcraft that was then required for scouts. Marble's knives were offered with a variety of handles, but the most popular was a stacked leather washer handle introduced and popularized by Webster. Marble Arms ended most knife production in 1976, selling the trademark to an overseas business. 

===Marble Waterproof Compass===

Very familiar with navigating in the woods under a plethora of conditions, Webster invented a compass that could be easily viewed from any angl under any weather conditions. Marble crafted the compass with a pin-back, reasoning that it would be significantly harder to lose a compass attached to your shirt than it would be to lose one that was just thrown in your pocket. Marble's compass was the first-ever to use a "compass card," a Webster invention that caused the entire compass-face to rotate instead of just the compass needle, resulting in a new compass that was easy to read in any lighting conditions. The Marble Waterproof Compass was a gamechanger for personal navigation, as it was easy to read if you were unfamiliar with orienteering and it was small enough to pin to your jacket and carry every day. In addition to extensive use of the Marble Compass by soldiers during WWI, both Admiral Peary and Admiral Byrd are said to have worn brass-button Marble Waterproof Compasses on their jackets while mounting several of their expeditions to the North and South Poles. 

===Marble Game Getter===

The first Marble Game Getter was a double-barreled combination gun that featured a folding stock, intended to make it easier to carry when trapping. The original Game Getter Model 1908 was manufactured from 1908 until 1914, and a second edition was released seven years later (Model 1921) and offered in several barrel lengths: 12, 15, and 18-inches. The National Firearms Act of 1934 reduced the number of sizes offered to one, as the company chose to avoid new taxes and restrictions imposed on firearms with barrel lengths under 18-inches. The gun was discontinued entirely in 1942, before the company began producing the latest Marble Game Getter model in 2009. Notably, 26th-President Teddy Roosevelt is said to have enjoyed using both the Game Getter and Marble products in general, going as far as to carry Marble knives, compasses, and matchboxes on his expeditions to Africa in 1909 and to the Amazon in 1914.

===Marble Match Safe===

After falling into the Sturgeon River while camping, thus soaking the matches he needed to light a fire and dry himself, Webster Marble set out to invent a waterproof matchbox. Webster created the first prototype by sliding an empty 12 gauge shotgun shell into an empty 10 gauge shotgun shell, creating a small waterproof pocket. The official Marble's Match Safe was a small metal cylinder with a striking surface on the outside and an attached lid that formed a waterproof seal to protect the matches stored inside, first patented in 1900. The first Marble Match Safe was manufactured until 1903 and featured a small screw that attached the lid to the container, which was subsequently removed from the match safes manufactured from 1903 to 1928. In 1928 the model was once again updated to feature a ribbed metal striking surface, this time produced by Marble Arms until production ended in the 1940s. 

On May 21, 1927, aviator Charles Lindbergh successfully completed the first non-stop, solo, from New York City to Paris across the Atlantic Ocean. He relied on a Marble Match Safe to keep his matches dry for that 33-hour flight, and kept a small Marble Compass pinned to his coat. Lindbergh would eventually carry numerous Marble products on future continental flights and tours, several of which are now preserved by the Smithsonian.

==Recognition==

In addition to notable outdoorsmen who used Marble products, including Teddy Roosevelt, Charles Lindbergh, and Admirals Peary and Byrd, both the United States Army and the British Army ordered vital tools from Marble. The British Army adopted Marble Safety Axes in 1903, and made Marble hunting knives standard-issue for soldiers in 1916. The United States Army installed Marble Compasses in army trucks in WWI, and the United States Navy ordered hundreds of Pilot Survival Knives in 1958. Both the Boy Scouts of America and the Girl Scouts of America endorsed Marble knives as the official knife of their respective organizations, encouraging scouts across the country to keep a Marble knife in their pockets. In 2010, Marble Arms was recognized as one of "Michigan's Top 50 Companies to Watch."

Webster Marble was an early inductee to the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame, created by the National Sporting Goods Association in 1955. Marble's legacy in the industry was solidified with his induction to the Hall of Fame in 1965 alongside Fred Bowman, creator of Wilson Sporting Goods, and Howard Head, inventor of laminated skis.

===Collections===

Items invented by Webster Marble and manufactured by his company are held in the permanent collections of numerous institutions, including the Smithsonian, National Museum of American History, National Air and Space Museum, Pritzker Military Museum & Library, Canadian War Museum, and Buffalo Bill Center of the West. In addition, his products have appeared in temporary exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the J.M. Davis Arms and Historical Museum in Claremore, Oklahoma.

===Webster Marble: Inventing the Outdoors Museum===

In 2015, the Michigan History Center in Lansing (operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources) curated the first solo exhibition of Webster Marble's products and influence following a large donation of Marble Arms memorabilia from collector Dennis Pace. Pace had acquired more than 300-pieces of Marble related material over 40 years, including marketing material, literature, and Marble Arms products. He donated his collection to the history center for use in a future exhibit and was ultimately named curator of such exhibit shortly after in recognition of his vast knowledge on the topic. Pace worked with Marble's great-grandchildren to find photos and information in their family archives to accompany his donation in the exhibit. The Webster Marble exhibit quickly grew to be one of the most popular the history center had ever displayed, and in 2016 it was loaned to the Michigan Iron Industry Museum in Marquette County. It was on display there until 2017, when it was placed in storage while a permanent facility was constructed. 

In 2019, the Webster Marble: Inventing the Outdoors Museum opened in the newly-built Delta County Multi-Use Complex at the U.P. State Fairgrounds in Escanaba, Michigan. The permanent building is shared by several local organizations and is located just a ten-minute drive from the Marble Arms manufacturing facility. The 4,000 sq. ft. exhibit offers free admission and features a Ford Model T touring vehicle, Marble Game Getters, marketing material, and many of Marble's safety axes, hunting knives, gun sights, and match boxes. The Webster Marble exhibit marks the first time the Michigan History Center has ever permanently loaned a portion of its collection to another facility.

===Webster L. Marble Day===

On November 5, 2015, Escanaba-native and Michigan State Senator Tom Casperson introduced a resolution to declare November 15 "Webster L. Marble Day" in the State of Michigan. He chose November 15 intentionally, as it the annual opening day of deer hunting season in Michigan. 

Casperson's campaign was successful, and the state government accepted his resolution to declare November 15 Michigan's annual "Webster L. Marble Day." Marble Day is celebrated locally in Gladstone and Escanaba, with the Marble Museum hosting special events and promotions every year.

Rebecca was launched at Charleston in 1802, possibly under another name. She first appeared in online British sources in 1805. In 1805, Rebecca began a voyage as a slave ship in the triangular trade in enslaved people but fell prey to Spanish privateers after she had embarked captives.

==Career==

Rebecca first appeared in Lloyd's Register in 1805.

Captain William Thompson sailed from Liverpool on 18 March 1805. He acquired captives at Loango and Cabinda.

==Fate==

In December 1805, Lloyd's List reported that Rebecca, Thompson, master, , Christie, master, and , Grice, master, had been captured at Angola on 1 September. They were among the seven vessels off the Congo River that had fallen prey to a privateer. The privateer was described as being of 22 guns and 350 men. Rebecca's captor sent her to the River Plate.

A second report named the captors as L'Orient, of 14 guns, and Dromedario, of 22 guns. The captured vessels arrived in the River Plate before 12 November.

Spanish records report that in June 1805, Viceroy Sobremonte, of Argentina, issued two letters of marque, one for Dolores (24 guns), Currand, master, and Berro y Errasquin, owner, and one for Dromedario (20 guns), Hippolito Mordel, master, and Canuerso y Masini, owner. The two sailed for the African coast, looking to capture enslaving ships. In three months of cruising Dolores captured three ships and one brig, carrying a total 600 enslaved people. Dromedario captured five ships, carrying a total of 500 enslaved people.

Rebecca's entry in the 1806 volume of the Register of Shipping (S), carried the annotation "Captured".

In 1805, 30 British slave ships were lost. Thirteen were lost on the coast of Africa. During the period 1793 to 1807, war, rather than maritime hazards or slave resistance, was the greatest cause of vessel losses among British slave vessels.

CATEGORIES: 2019 plays, Plays about religion and science, Plays set in the 21st century, Plays set in Wyoming, Off-Broadway plays, Fiction set in 2017, Strauss–Howe generational theory

Heroes of the Fourth Turning is a 2019 play by American writer Will Arbery. It focuses on a group of young Catholic intellectuals who reunite at their college in Wyoming. It premiered off-Broadway. It was received positively by both theatrical critics and conservative media and was a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize in drama.

==History==

The playwright, Will Arbery, is the son of Glenn Arbery, the president of Wyoming Catholic College (WCC), a small liberal arts college in Lander, Wyoming, that combines a great books curriculum with outdoor education. The play's fictional Transfiguration College is based on WCC. The title is a reference to the Fourth Turning, a concept in the Strauss–Howe generational theory. Throughout the writing process, he grappled with how to invite audiences to engage with the characters' ideas without asking them to empathize with them or providing a platform for hateful speech.

The play grew out of a shorter work that Arbery wrote for Ensemble Studio Theater shortly before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, depicting reactions to an anticipated Clinton victory. After Trump won, he rewrote and expanded the work. The play premiered off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in New York City in 2019, directed by Danya Taymor.

==Characters==

==Plot==

The play is set in 2017, shortly after the Unite the Right rally. It opens with Justin shooting a deer. The four friends spend an evening in a backyard after attending a reunion at their college. They debate numerous political and religious topics. Throughout, a loud sound, which Justin says is a generator, intermittently interrupts the characters. Kevin, drunk, seeks a girlfriend. Midway through the play, they are joined by Gina Presson, their former mentor, who chastises Teresa for her new political beliefs. The play ends with an impassioned monologue from Emily about her pain.

==Reception==

The play was received positively by theatrical critics. Jesse Green, writing for The New York Times, called it "a red-state unicorn" that "explores the lives and ideas of conservatives with affection, understanding and deep knowledge — if not, ultimately, approval." He praised "its eagerness to admit, and to subtly criticize by juxtaposition, all arguments". Vinson Cunningham, in The New Yorker, wrote, "Much of the thrill of the play comes in hearing ultraconservative ideas—scarce on New York stages—discussed in earnest, and carried to their most ominous conclusions." Alissa Wilkinson wrote for Vox, "Arbery is neither blindly accepting nor promoting of his characters; to validate or advance a specific worldview isn't the play's intention. Instead, it gently and sometimes joltingly lets Justin, Emily, Teresa, and Kevin lay out their constellation of individual beliefs on their own terms."

It was also received positively by conservative and Catholic publications, such as the Catholic Herald, whose Chad Pecknold wrote, "Arbery's play is remarkable for never letting progressives rest in their dismissals of conservatives, and also for holding up a critical mirror to the often messy disputes that conservatives have amongst themselves." In a glowing review for The American Conservative, Rod Dreher wrote, "I can't think of a single novel, film, or play that better illustrates the spirits of our culture war."

It was a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize in drama, described in the nomination as "a scrupulously hewn drama." At the 2020 Obie Awards, it won in the playwriting category and received a special citation for its creative team and ensemble. At the 2020 Lucille Lortel Awards, it picked up the top "outstanding play" prize.

"Please Don't Go" is a song recorded by the South Korean girl group 2NE1, performed as a duet by CL and Minzy. It was released as a digital single through YG Entertainment on November 20, 2009, although no accompanying music video was released to promote it. It was later included on 2NE1's debut studio album To Anyone in September 2010.

==Background and release==

"Please Don't Go" was announced as a surprise single one day before its release on November 19, 2009. A source from YG Entertainment said that the single was a project that they were secretly working on for 2NE1's new album, which was originally intended to be released that month. However, the album release was postponed and no music video was produced in order to not let the staff around them know. 

==Commercial performance==

Upon its release on November 20, "Please Don't Go" overtook "You and I" by fellow 2NE1 member Park Bom for the number one spot on real-time charts in South Korea. On the Melon weekly chart, the song peaked at number 2 during the week of November 22–28, 2009, with 2PM's "Heartbeat" occupying number one. The song entered at number 30 on the inaugural chart issue of the newly established Gaon Digital Chart for the week of December 27, 2009 – January 2, 2010. It placed at number 82 on the monthly Gaon Digital Chart issue for January 2010, falling from number 7 from the previous month.

==Live performances==

The duo first performed the song live at the 2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards on November 21 as part of 2NE1's set, and was followed up with a performance at the SBS Love Sharing Concert on November 22. That same day, the duo began promoting the song on the music program Inkigayo, which they appeared on for several weeks.

[[Pietro Secchia]]

Pietro Secchia (19 December 1903 – 7 July 1971) was an Italian politician, anti-fascist partisan leader and a prominent leader of the Italian Communist Party.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Secchia was born into a working-class family. His father was a member of the Italian Socialist Party. In 1919, he joined the Socialist Youth Federation, where he quickly rose through its ranks after he participated in strikes and anti-fascist actions in the "Biennio Rosso". Being an active and well-known political activist, Secchia joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1921 at the time of its formation.

===Anti-fascist resistance===

In 1924, Secchia was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth Federation, takes part in the work of the Vth Congress of the Communist International. From 1926, he was one of the leaders of the communist underground in fascist Italy. In 1928, he became a member of the Central Committee of the PCI, then a member of its Politburo. In April 1931, he was arrested and sentenced by the Special Tribunal to 18 years in prison. Until 1943, he was in prison and in exile, from where he was released by partisans. Secchia participated in the Italian resistance movement and became the general commissar of the Brigate Garibaldi brigades.

===Post-World War II===

In February 1948, following the VI National Congress of the PCI, he was elected Deputy Secretary General, a position he held until 1955. In 1946 he was elected as a deputy to the Constituent Assembly and in 1948 he was elected senator in the ranks of the Popular Democratic Front, remaining in the Senate until his death. Despite the party line, Secchia kept with him a group of loyal comrades from the former partisan groups who did not surrender their weapons, in case of an attempted coup d'état by the right.

Often not in line with Palmiro Togliatti's policy and sometimes considered as his possible alternative, in 1954 Secchia's position within the party began to weaken: in fact he was first joined and then replaced by Giorgio Amendola in the organizational direction. Secchia and other elements were thus progressively marginalized for their more radical stance and opposition to the "reformist" trend within the PCI. Furthermore, the death of Stalin and his denunciation of the 20th Congress of the CPSU had made the position of the components that were linked to a more organically Leninist vision (of which Secchia was the leading exponent) particularly uncomfortable both in the party and within the broader electorate of the PCI.

Eventually, as a result of theft from the party's secret funds by one of Secchia's closest associates, he disappeared from positions of national importance. He was removed from his role in the national organization, and was instead appointed head, from 1955 to the beginning of 1957, of the Lombardy regional secretariat. He subsequently directed the party's publishing business until the end of 1962.

===Later life===

For most of the early sixties, he was working on the study of the history of the PCI and the resistance movement, and published multiple books and memoirs. 

From the end of the sixties he devoted himself to international politics. He advocated for the emancipation and independence of Africa, visiting Egypt and Syria in July-August 1967, North Africa in October-November of the same year; Jordan, and again Syria in December 1969; Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia in October 1971. In January 1972, he traveled to Chile, where he supported the government of Salvador Allende, making him the last Western leader to visit the Latin American nation before the advent of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. On his return to Italy, he suffered an illness that held him between life and death for a few months. The unusual nature of this illness led Secchia, despite having no proof, to believe that he had been poisoned by the CIA. Secchia died in July 1973.

[[Myosotis goyenii subsp. goyenii]]

CATEGORIES: Myosotis, Endemic flora of New Zealand, Endangered flora of New Zealand, Flora of the South Island, Plants described in 1891

Myosotis goyenii subsp. ''goyenii is a subspecies of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, endemic to southern South Island of New Zealand. Donald Petrie described the species M. goyenii'' in 1891. Plants of this subspecies of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes which form loose clumps, with ebracteate, erect inflorescences, and white corollas with partly exserted stamens.  

==Taxonomy and etymology==

Myosotis goyenii Petrie subsp. goyenii is in the plant family Boraginaceae. The species M. goyenii was described by Donald Petrie in 1891. 

Multiple specimens of original material (syntypes) of Myosotis goyenii were collected in different localities in Otago, New Zealand by Peter Goyen (from Arrowtown) and Donald Petrie (from the Cardrona Valley and Lake Hawea). The lectotype was designated by Carlos Lehnebach, and is lodged at the herbarium of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (WELT SP002484).

Donald Petrie gave this species the specific epithet, goyenii, to honor his friend, Peter Goyen (1845–1927), who collected several specimens of M. goyenii. Like Petrie himself, Goyen was a school inspector and naturalist who lived on the South Island of New Zealand.

This is one of two subspecies recognized in Myosotis goyenii; the other is M. goyenii subsp. infima. The subspecies are allopatric, with M. goyenii subsp. goyenii occupying schist substrates in Southland and Otago, and M. goyenii subsp. infima found on limestone and calcareous substrates in Marlborough and Canterbury.

Myosotis goyenii subsp. goyenii can be distinguished from M. goyenii subsp. infima by its clumps of single rosettes that have a central woody taproot, and the following floral characteristics: a long style (> 6 mm), pistil that is 1.6–2.8× longer than the calyx, filaments attached < 1 mm below the scales, and anthers only partly included (with the tips equal to or just surpassing the scales). By contrast, M. goyenii subsp. infima plants form caespitose clumps of multiple rosettes that have fibrous roots, and have flowers with a short style (< 6 mm), pistil that is  1 mm below the faucal scales, and anthers fully included.

==Phylogeny==

Myosotis goyenii was shown to be a part of the monophyletic southern hemisphere lineage of Myosotis in phylogenetic analyses of standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA regions). Within the southern hemisphere lineage, species relationships were not well resolved. Myosotis goyenii subsp. goyenii was included in one previous phylogenetic study. Of the three sequenced individuals of M. goyenii, the two from Otago (M. goyenii subsp. goyenii) grouped with each other and with M. albosericea in the nuclear ribosomal DNA analyses, and with M. australis and other species in the chloroplast DNA analyses. 

==Description==

Myosotis goyenii subsp. goyenii plants have long woody, branched taproots, and are single rosettes that often grow together to form loose clumps. The rosette leaves have petioles 10–48 mm long. The rosette leaf blades are 7–40 mm long by 3–11 mm wide (length: width ratio 2.2–5.3: 1), usually narrowly oblanceolate, oblanceolate or narrowly obovate, widest at or above the middle (rarely below the middle), with an acute apex (rarely obtuse). Both surfaces and the edges of the leaf are densely covered in straight, appressed, antrorse (forward-facing) hairs that are oriented parallel to the mid vein. Each rosette has 2–40 erect, usually once-branched (sometimes unbranched), ebracteate inflorescences that are up to 350 mm long and are usually bifurcating in an open, forked 'V' shape near the tips. The cauline leaves are up to 13 per inflorescence and are similar to the rosette leaves but smaller with shorter petioles, and decrease in size toward the tip. Each inflorescence has up to 26 flowers, each borne on a pedicel up to 1.3 mm long at fruiting, and each without a bract. The calyx is 3–5 mm long at flowering and 4–6 mm long at fruiting, lobed to half to almost all of its length, and densely covered in antrorse, straight to flexuous, appressed to patent hairs. The corolla is white, up to 14 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, petals that are broadly ovate, obovate, broadly obovate or broadly obovate, and small yellow scales alternating with the petals. The stamens are 6.1–7.5 mm long (measured from the base of the calyx to the anther tips) with filaments 0.3–0.4 mm long that are attached to the corolla tube < 1 mm below the base of the scales. The anthers are partly exserted above the scales, with the anther tips equal to or just surpassing the scales. The pistil is 8–11 mm long with a style that is 7–10 mm long at fruiting. The four smooth, shiny, light to dark brown nutlets are 1.7–2.7 mm long by 1.0–1.3 mm wide and narrowly ovoid in shape.

The chromosome number of M. goyenii subsp. goyenii is unknown.

The pollen of M. goyenii subsp. goyenii is unknown.

It flowers and fruits from November–March, with the main flowering and fruiting period from December–February.

==Distribution and habitat==

Myosotis goyenii subsp. goyenii is a forget-me-not endemic to Otago and Southland in the South Island of New Zealand, from 650–1300 m ASL. It is found on rock (schist) outcrops, ledges, cliffs and shingle.

==Conservation status==

The species M. goyenii is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon on the most recent assessment (2017-2018) under the New Zealand Threatened Classification system for plants, with the qualifier "Sp" (Sparse).

Robert Bauer (born 1942) is an American painter who creates pictures of people, landscapes, backyards, and gardens. Bauer's paintings of backyards and gardens gained him much recognition and his art has been shown in multiple exhibitions.

==Personal life==

Bauer was born in Iowa in 1942 and spent his childhood on a farm near Williamsburg, Iowa, United States. Despite enjoying drawing as a child and attending art classes in high school, Bauer was not aware until years later that he could make a living from painting. He became a Marine after graduating from high school and drew pictures when he was not on duty. Bauer visited art museums and read about the history of art in his spare time. In 1965, Bauer enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts to work on art that involved casts and live studio models. Bauer and his wife Barbara have two children.

==Career==

Shortly after Bauer finished his art training in 1967, Kenmore Galleries in Philadelphia placed his art in a show titled Four Young Realists. He moved to Iowa in the same year to paint, with most of his art throughout the late 1960s and the early 1970s being paintings of figures that were a mixture of twentieth-century avant-garde funk and seventeenth-century Dutch realism. In 1972, Bauer completed four paintings with three of them being sold to the Davenport Municipal Art Gallery, a bank, and a Maryland museum. He completed 35 to 40 paintings in 1973. Bauer went to schools to show his painting process and answer questions in the 1970s. After that period, Bauer's paintings depicted people as models in natural settings and landscapes. He began to paint backyards and gardens in 1980 and those paintings have given Bauer much of his recognition. He works with acrylic paint and watercolor painting.

===Exhibitions===

In 1974, his painting "Iowa County" won a show prize at the Davenport Municipal Art Gallery in Davenport, Iowa. His work has been shown in more than 50 exhibits including Allan Stone Gallery in New York City, the Thomas Segal Gallery in Boston, the Olson-Larsen Galleries in Des Moines, Iowa, the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Forum Gallery in New York City, among others. Bauer received two grants from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and two grants from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. He was a Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition finalist in 2006.

[[Myosotis goyenii subsp. infima]]

CATEGORIES: Myosotis, Endemic flora of New Zealand, Endangered flora of New Zealand, Flora of the South Island, Plants described in 2021

Myosotis goyenii subsp. ''infima'' Meudt & Heenan is a subspecies of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, endemic to central South Island of New Zealand. Heidi Meudt and Peter Heenan described this subspecies in 2021. Plants of this subspecies of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes which form caespitose clumps, with ebracteate, erect inflorescences, and white corollas with fully incluced stamens.  

==Taxonomy and etymology==

Myosotis goyenii subsp. infima Meudt & Heenan is in the plant family Boraginaceae. The subspecies was described by Heidi Meudt and Peter Heenan in 2021. 

The holotype was collected by Peter Heenan and Miles Giller in Canterbury, Waipara, South Dean and is lodged at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research (CHR 666639). There is also an isotype is lodged at the herbarium of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (WELT SP111309).

The subspecific epithet, infima, means lowest or lowermost in Latin (infimus), and refers to the filaments in the flower which are attached much lower in the corolla tube than those of M. goyenii subsp. goyenii.

This is one of two subspecies recognized in Myosotis goyenii; the other is M. goyenii subsp. goyenii. The subspecies are allopatric, with M. goyenii subsp. infima found on limestone and calcareous siltstone in Marlborough and Canterbury and M. goyenii subsp. goyenii occupying schist rocks in Southland and Otago.

M. goyenii subsp. infima plants can be distinguished from M. goyenii subsp. goyenii by its caespitose clumps of multiple rosettes that have fibrous roots, and have flowers with a short style (< 6 mm), pistil that is  1 mm below the faucal scales, and anthers fully included. By contrast, plants of M. goyenii subsp. infima form clumps of single rosettes that have a central woody taproot, and the following floral characteristics: a long style (> 6 mm), pistil that is 1.6–2.8× longer than the calyx, filaments attached < 1 mm below the scales, and anthers only partly included (with the tips equal to or just surpassing the scales).

==Phylogeny==

Myosotis goyenii was shown to be a part of the monophyletic southern hemisphere lineage of Myosotis in phylogenetic analyses of standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA regions). Within the southern hemisphere lineage, species relationships were not well resolved. Of the three individuals of M. goyenii sequenced in these studies, one is from Canterbury (M. goyenii subsp. infima).

==Description==

Myosotis goyenii subsp. infima plants are single rosettes with fibrous roots that often grow together to form caespitose clumps or tufts. The rosette leaves have petioles 10–48 mm long. The rosette leaf blades are 7–40 mm long by 3–11 mm wide (length: width ratio 2.2–5.3: 1), usually narrowly oblanceolate, oblanceolate or narrowly obovate, widest at or above the middle (rarely below the middle), with an acute apex (rarely obtuse). Both surfaces and the edges of the leaf are densely covered in straight, appressed, antrorse (forward-facing) hairs that are oriented parallel to the mid vein. Each rosette has 2–40 erect, usually once-branched (sometimes unbranched), ebracteate inflorescences that are up to 350 mm long and are usually bifurcating in an open, forked 'V' shape near the tips. The cauline leaves are up to 8 per inflorescence and are similar to the rosette leaves but smaller with shorter petioles, and decrease in size toward the tip. Each inflorescence has up to 26 flowers, each borne on a pedicel up to 3 mm long at fruiting, and each without a bract. The calyx is 3–5 mm long at flowering and 4–6 mm long at fruiting, lobed to half to almost all of its length, and densely covered in antrorse, straight to flexuous, appressed to patent hairs. The corolla is white, up to 14 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, petals that are broadly ovate, obovate, broadly obovate or broadly obovate, and small yellow scales alternating with the petals. The stamens are 4.5–6.3 mm long (measured from the base of the calyx to the anther tips) with filaments 0.4–0.7 mm long that are attached to the corolla tube > 1 mm below the base of the scales. The anthers are fully included in the corolla tube. The pistil is 5–7 mm long with a style that is 3–6 mm long at fruiting. The four smooth, shiny, light to dark brown nutlets are 1.7–2.7 mm long by 1.0–1.3 mm wide and narrowly ovoid in shape.

The chromosome number of M. goyenii subsp. infima is unknown.

The pollen of M. goyenii subsp. infima is unknown.

It flowers and fruits from October–June, with the main flowering and fruiting period in January.

==Distribution and habitat==

Myosotis goyenii subsp. infima is a forget-me-not endemic to Marlborough and Canterbury in the South Island of New Zealand, from 450–1200 m ASL. It is found on rock (limestone and calcareous siltstone) slopes, outcrops, crevices and escarpments.

==Conservation status==

The subspecies M. goyenii subsp. infima was assessed (as taxonomically indeterminate Myosotis "Waipapa") as being Data Deficient. It was not yet assessed in the most recent assessment (2017-2018) under the New Zealand Threatened Classification system for plants.

[[History of Baptist Christianity in Sichuan]]

CATEGORIES: Baptist Christianity in Sichuan, History of Baptists, History of Christianity in Sichuan

The history of Baptist Christianity in Sichuan (or "West China") began in the late 1800s when missionaries began arriving from the United States. Baptist missionaries in Sichuan were organized under the American Baptist Missionary Union, later renamed American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. Missionary activity in China generated controversy among many native Chinese and faced armed opposition during both the Boxer Rebellion and the later Communist movement in China. Although the former did not affect Sichuan so much as some other parts of China, the province was one of the hotbeds of anti-missionary riots throughout its ecclesiastical history.

Numerous mission properties and native church leaders in Sichuan were respectively destroyed and killed by communists in the mid-1930s. Missionary activity ceased after the communist take over of China in 1949. Under government pressure in the 1950s, Baptist congregations and other Protestant churches across China severed their ties with overseas churches, and their congregations subsequently merged into the Three-Self Patriotic Church. Since 1980, their services have been provided by the China Christian Council.

==History==

Baptist Christianity was introduced into Sichuan by the American Baptist Missionary Union (ABMU, belonging to the American Baptist Churches USA). The first missionaries to reach the province were Rev. William M. Upcraft and Rev. George Warner, who sailed in 1889. The journey required many weeks before their arrival in Xuzhou the following year, where they established the mission's first station. Medical work was started by Rev. C. H. Finch in 1891, in the same year Rev. Robert Wellwood and his wife joined the mission.

At the end of 1892, the ABMU was represented by nine missionaries, with medical work, two preaching places, women's classes, a boys' school, a Sunday school and eleven converts. In 1893, twelve new workers joined the mission, and subsequently the opening of a new station in Jiading in 1894. At that time, the number of missionaries connected with the West China Mission was twenty-two. A small church had been gathered at Xuzhou. The remote character of the province and its need of Christian missionary labors lent a romantic and unusual interest to the work of the West China Mission, especially since that was the nearest approach of American Baptists to reaching the people of an "unevangelized" country, Tibet.

That same year (1894), Upcraft and H. J. Openshaw traveled to Yazhou and tried to rent some permanent quarters. According to Missionary Cameralogs: West China, "this stirred up opposition and vile placards were posted abusing the foreigners. However, the tide was turned in favor of the missionaries after successfully treating the servant of an official bitten by a snake, they were allowed to stay."

In 1895, a serious outbreak of anti-foreign agitation began in the capital Chengdu, and thence spread throughout the province. The missionaries had no choice but to temporarily leave their posts. Work was resumed after their return in the spring of 1896. By the middle of the year 1900, the Church had 68 converts with some 200 names on the enquirers' roll. The year 1900 was marked by the anti-Christian uprising known as Boxer Rebellion. Although this unrest did not affect Sichuan so much as some other parts of China, missionaries were obliged by consular orders to retire to the coast. During their absence, the local converts defended their faith and carried on all the regular services. Two new stations were opened at Ningyuan and Chengdu in 1905 and 1909 respectively; while Rev. Joseph Taylor and his wife were transferred from Yazhou to Chengdu.

In 1910, the ABMU changed its name to American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (ABFMS), and became one of the four founding societies of the West China Union University, together with American Methodist Episcopal Mission (Methodist Episcopal Church), Canadian Methodist Mission (Methodist Church of Canada), and Friends' Foreign Mission Association (British Quakers).

During the 1911 Revolution which overthrew the Qing dynasty, Openshaw took care of the wounded, with his wife as auxiliary. The local Christians later told of Mrs. Openshaw's bravery during the siege of Yazhou, how she would play the organ and sing while bullets whizzed about the house.

In 1919, the ABFMS celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its West China Mission. In 1920, Rev. A. G. Adams assumed responsibility for the work of the evangelistic field, which had been for several years under the direction of Rev. David Crockett Graham, a polymath Baptist minister who was ordained at the First Baptist Church of Fairport, New York, in 1911, and spent nearly forty years in Sichuan Province, arriving shortly after his ordination. He was also one of the key figures in the discovery of the archaeological site now known as Sanxingdui, when a collection of jade pieces contributed to the Museum of Art, Archaeology and Ethnology at the West China Union University by an English Anglican missionary, Vyvyan Donnithorne, in 1931, drew his attention, subsequently leading to an archaeological excavation in 1934.

By 1913, the American Baptists had 793 church members; and by the end of 1921, 1,263 members.

In 1924, a Swedish American missionary Esther Nelson was sent to Sichuan by the First Swedish Baptist Church of Minneapolis. Between 1924 and 1945, she worked primarily as a nurse and medical educator in various Baptist hospitals. She applied to become a full-time evangelist after the formation of the Baptist General Conference's Foreign Mission Board in 1945. This led her to the city of Huili in Southern Sichuan at the end of 1947, where she worked until 1950, when foreign missionaries were driven out of China by the newly established communist government. 

In 1938, Alfred James Broomhall, an English Baptist missionary, entered China through the China Inland Mission. In 1946, he entered the territory of the Independent Nuosu in Southern Sichuan, with a team to establish a sustained Christian witness among them. He was only able to live among the Nuosu people from 1947 to 1951, and spent his last few months under house arrest before being expelled from China by communist regime; but his team was able to plant seeds that were going to bear fruit in coming decades.

==Since 1949==

After the communist takeover of China in 1949, Protestant Churches in the country were forced to sever their ties with respective overseas Churches, which then led to the merging of all the denominations into the communist-sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic Church. The China Christian Council was founded at the third national Christian conference in 1980 to unite and provide services for Protestant churches, formulating Church Order and encouraging theological education. In 2018, the detention of 100 Christians including their pastor Wang Yi in Sichuan, raised concerns about religious crackdown in China.

Notable new councillors were a candidate representing the Greens (Alan Somerville) and a 21 year old non-binary councillor (Elliot Weir) 

The Council elected Gretchen Robertson (the highest polling candidate with 15 years experience) as the chair (7 to 5) and new councillor Lloyd McCall as deputy (7 to 5). The previous chair (Cr Noone) said he was no longer the best person for the role.

The 1997 Goody's Headache Powder 500 was the eighth stock car race of the 1997 NASCAR Winston Cup Series and the 48th iteration of the event. The race was held on Sunday, April 20, 1997, in Martinsville, Virginia at Martinsville Speedway, a 0.526 permanent oval-shaped short track. The race took the scheduled 500 laps to complete. At race's end, Hendrick Motorsports driver Jeff Gordon would dominate the majority of the race, recovering from a mid-race spin to take his 23rd career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory, his fourth victory of the season, and his second consecutive victory. To fill out the top three, Petty Enterprises driver Bobby Hamilton and Roush Racing driver Mark Martin would finish second and third, respectively.

==Background==

Martinsville Speedway is an NASCAR-owned stock car racing track located in Henry County, in Ridgeway, Virginia, just to the south of Martinsville. At 0.526 miles (0.847 km) in length, it is the shortest track in the NASCAR Cup Series. The track was also one of the first paved oval tracks in NASCAR, being built in 1947 by H. Clay Earles. It is also the only remaining race track that has been on the NASCAR circuit from its beginning in 1948.

===Entry list===

==Qualifying==

Qualifying was split into two rounds. The first round was held on Friday, April 18, at 3:00 PM EST. Each driver would have one lap to set a time. During the first round, the top 25 drivers in the round would be guaranteed a starting spot in the race. If a driver was not able to guarantee a spot in the first round, they had the option to scrub their time from the first round and try and run a faster lap time in a second round qualifying run, held on Saturday, April 19, at 1:00 PM EST. As with the first round, each driver would have one lap to set a time. Positions 26-38 would be decided on time, and depending on who needed it, the 39th thru either the 42nd, 43rd, or 44th position would be based on provisionals. Four spots are awarded by the use of provisionals based on owner's points. The fifth is awarded to a past champion who has not otherwise qualified for the race. If no past champion needs the provisional, the field would be limited to 42 cars. If a champion needed it, the field would expand to 43 cars. If the race was a companion race with the NASCAR Winston West Series, four spots would be determined by NASCAR Winston Cup Series provisionals, while the final two spots would be given to teams in the Winston West Series, leaving the field at 44 cars.

Kenny Wallace, driving for FILMAR Racing, would win the pole, setting a time of 20.153 and an average speed of 93.961.

[[Spanish patrol boat Serviola]]

CATEGORIES: Patrol vessels of the Spanish Navy, Ships built in Spain, 1990 ships

''Serviola'' (P-71) is the lead ship of the Serviolas of the Spanish Navy built in 1990. The ship has been involved in numerous anti-piracy and drug interdiction missions off the coast of Spain and in the Gulf of Guinea.

==Description==

Serviola measures 67 long, 10 wide, and has a draft of 3. It has an average speed of 8.1 and a maximum speed of 15.3. In December 2021, the Spanish Navy announced that 12.7 mm "Guardian 30" naval weapons station would be installed aboard Serviola and several other patrol boats and frigates by the domestic company Escribano.

==History==

In April 2019, Serviola detected an in-progress hijacking of a Nigerian merchant vessel by pirates. Upon the Serviola's approach the pirates fled, but they had been able to steal small valuables from the crew. In May, Serviola was dispatched by Spanish authorities alongside a frigate from Equatorial Guinea to conduct an anti-piracy operation aboard the hijacked heavy-lift ship Blue Marlin. The Blue Marlin had been boarded by seven pirates using a zodiac boat on 5 May after unloading its cargo in the territorial waters of Equatorial Guinea. Serviola approached the Blue Marlin and seven embarked Spanish Marines boarded the vessel. They found that the pirates had left the crew unharmed, but had severely damaged the pilothouse before leaving. Serviola left the vicinity after it was arranged for a tug to assist Blue Marlin into safe harbor. Serviola continued to operate in the Gulf of Guinea as an anti-piracy ship through the rest of 2019 and into 2020.

In February 2021, Serviola was part of a drug interdiction mission in the Bay of Biscay. She intercepted the small bunkering tanker Nehir which was smuggling drugs off the Galician coast, sending a team from the National Police to board the ship. However, the smugglers had begun to scuttle their ship in order to prevent evidence of the drugs they were ferrying from falling into the hands of authorities. The National Police rescued the nine smugglers from the sinking ship, and also managed to seize over 3,000 of cocaine before the ship sank about two hours later.

Serviola was involved in a minor incident between Spain and the United Kingdom in July 2020, when she transited through the territorial waters of Gibraltar for roughly 45 minutes before being escorted out by the Royal Navy vessel Pursuer. The intrusion into their territorial waters drew criticism from several British maritime officials, who speculated that it was in response to newly imposed quarantine measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2022, Serviola brought the Spanish Ambassador to Côte d'Ivoire, Rafael Ortiz, to the port city of Abidjan on a diplomatic mission. The ship was presented to Ivorian officials in an effort to improve bilateral relations between the two countries' navies to combat piracy in the region.

Edward Mosberg (January 6, 1926 – September 21, 2022) was a Polish-American Holocaust survivor, educator, and philanthropist. During the Holocaust, he was held by the Nazis from 14 years of age in Kraków Ghetto, Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp, Auschwitz concentration camp,  Mauthausen concentration camp, and a slave labor camp in Linz, Austria, that was liberated by the US Army in 1945. Nearly all of his family were murdered in the Holocaust.

In 2019, Mosberg was awarded Poland’s highest civilian honor by Polish President Andrzej Duda, the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. In 2020, American football player DeSean Jackson, who had made an antisemitic post on social media which he later apologized for, accepted an invitation from the then-94-year-old Mosberg to join him on a visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp, to learn about the Holocaust.

==Early life==

Mosberg was born in Kraków, Poland, to Bronislawa and Ludwig, and was Jewish. His parents owned a department store, and prayed at the Wolf Popper Synagogue.  His two sisters were Halina and Karolina.

==The Holocaust==

In 1939 when Mosberg was 13 years old, Nazi Germany invaded his hometown. In 1940, one year later, the Kraków Ghetto, a Nazi ghetto, was created during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. His immediate family, grandparents, cousins, and aunt were moved into one small apartment there. In 1941, his father was killed in a round-up. In 1942, his grandmother, aunts, and cousins were deported to Belzec concentration camp in German-occupied Poland.

In 1943, the Kraków Ghetto was liquidated, and the remaining Mosberg family was moved to the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp in Płaszów just south of Kraków, a Nazi concentration camp operated by the SS, which had been constructed on the grounds of two former Jewish cemeteries. Mosberg witnessed a great number of atrocities committed by SS camp commandant Amon Göth, who was later tried, convicted, and hanged as a war criminal.

In May 1944, Mosberg’s mother and sisters were sent to the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz concentration camp in southern Poland. Auschwitz was the largest Nazi concentration camp, and over a million Jews were killed there between 1940 and 1945. His mother was killed in an Auschwitz gas chamber, and then her body was sent to its crematorium. Mosberg was deported a few days later, first to Auschwitz.

He was then deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, where Mosberg performed slave labor. In Mauthausen, prisoners were forced to work in a quarry, pulling boulders as heavy as 110 pounds up 186 steps from morning until night, whipped by Nazi guards. Mosberg said: "If you stopped for a moment, the SS either shot you or pushed you off the cliff to your death." Mosberg was next sent to a slave labor camp in Linz, Austria. The camp was liberated by the U.S. Army on May 5, 1945.

Nearly all of Mosberg's family were murdered during the Holocaust, including his parents and sisters.

==Life after the Holocaust==

Mosberg was then sent to a hospital in Italy to recover from tuberculosis. In Italy, he reconnected with Cesia (Cecile) Storch, whom he had earlier met in the camps. She had been imprisoned with his sisters.

Cecile (nicknamed Cesia; née Storch) Mosberg, was born in Kraków and had survived Auschwitz. Many of her family members had also been killed.  Mosberg and Cecile had both been liberated from German concentration camps by American soldiers.

After liberation, Mosberg returned to Poland for a short amount of time, but encountered strong antisemitism and he and Cecile then moved to Belgium. Mosberg married Cecile in Brussels, Belgium, in 1947.

They then immigrated to the United States in 1951 with their 18-month-old-daughter Beatrice, and lived in East Harlem, New York. Thereafter they had two more children, Louise (in 1953) and Caroline (in 1966), and as of 2016 had seven grandchildren and two grand-grandchildren.  Cecile died at 92 years of age in 2020, after the two had been married for 72 years.

In the United States, Mosberg first worked small jobs, and ultimately became a real-estate developer. The family moved to Parsippany, New Jersey, and later lived in Morris Plains, New Jersey.

==Holocaust awareness promoter==

Mosberg devoted the last years of his life to Holocaust education, was one of the biggest supporters of the International March of the Living (often attending the march wearing his original concentration camp uniform) and appeared in two documentary films. He served as honorary chairman of From the Depths, an organization dedicated to “preserving the memory of the Holocaust and to give a name to those who were brutally murdered in the dark days of the Holocaust." He was committed to strengthening Polish-Jewish dialogue and relations, and to recognizing the Polish Righteous Among the Nations, those Polish non-Jews who risked their lives for altruistic reasons to save Jews from the Nazis during the Holocaust.

===2006–19===

In 2006, Mosberg donated a Torah that was hidden from the Nazis to the Mount Freedom Jewish Center. In 2007, Mosberg and his wife received the Yad Vashem Remembrance Award.

In 2009, Mosberg was one of half a dozen people who met with Pope Benedict XVI at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, Israel.

In 2015 his story was featured in the documentary Witness: Passing the Torch of Holocaust Memory to New Generations. In 2017 he was in the documentary film Destination Unknown.

In early May 2018, Mosberg co-signed a letter asking Jersey City, New Jersey, Mayor Steven Fulop not to remove the Katyń Memorial from Exchange Place in the city, writing: "The memory of the Katyn massacre is an important part of the memory and memories of the Holocaust and we encourage you to reconsider your decision to remove this monument." On December 20, 2018, the nine-member Jersey City Council voted unanimously to adopt an ordinance that the monument remain where it stands in Exchange Place “in perpetuity”.

In June 2019, Polish President Andrzej Duda honored Mosberg with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.  It was given to Mosberg in recognition of his having developed Polish-Jewish dialogue, and his having promoted knowledge about the role of Polish people in saving Jews during the Holocaust. Accepting the award in Kraków, Mosberg  said: "I accept this award on behalf of myself, my wife, my children and grandchildren, and most importantly, in honor of my mother, father, siblings and six million Jews, brutally murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust."

Mosberg was the subject of a painting by artist David Kassan that appeared in September–December 2019 in an exhibition co-curated by the USC Shoah Foundation and USC’s Fisher Museum of Art, named "Facing Survival".

That same year, he was diagnosed with blood cancer. Mosberg said he did not fear death, however, because: "First, I already beat death once after the war when I had final stage tuberculosis – and I can do it again. Second, I died already 70 years ago when the Germans murdered my whole family..."

===2020–22===

Presenting Mosberg with the Ner Tamid Award for his global philanthropic work in February 2020, Consul General of Poland Adrian Kubicki said that the Polish and Jewish communities “have shared some beautiful moments and we also share some of the most painful memories," and that Mosberg was "an ambassador of truth” who has “done so much good around the world” in ensuring another tragedy like the Holocaust “never again happens to the Jewish nation, the Polish nation or any other nation.”

In July 2020, American football player DeSean Jackson, who had posted social media messages—which he later apologized for—citing an anti-semitic quote that he thought was a quote from Hitler, accepted an invitation from the then-94-year-old Mosberg to join him on a visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Mosberg said: "Jackson was very respectful. I would like to say God Bless Mr. Jackson for accepting my invitation."

Mosberg died in New Jersey, at 96 years of age, on September 21, 2022. 

Polish President Andrzej Duda and his wife attended Mosberg's funeral, and Duda announced that he was awarding  Mosberg the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, the highest Polish award in its class. It was awarded in recognition of Mosberg's achievements in advancing Polish-Jewish dialogue and developing cooperation between nations, and for preserving the memory of and communicating what happened in the Holocaust. Duda said Mosberg was a great and brave man both as a Jew and as a Pole, astutely testified about the complex history of the Jews in Poland, and loved Poland.

Writing of Mosberg's death, Polish Consul General Adrian Kubicki wrote that Mosberg was: "the most wonderful man I have ever met. He was a Holocaust Survivor, noble man and a great Polish patriot... My personal mentor. Irreplaceable."

[[Tonsala]]

CATEGORIES: Fossil taxa described in 1980, Paleogene Japan, Plotopteridae, Extinct flightless birds, Prehistoric bird genera

Tonsala is an extinct genus of Plotopteridae, a family of flightless seabird similar in biology with penguins, but more closely related to modern cormorants. The genus is known from terrains dated from the Late Oligocene of the State of Washington and Japan.

==History and Etymology==

In 1979, Storrs L. Olson and Hasegawa Yoshikazu identified several fossilized specimens of Late Oligocene and Early Miocene birds found in the State of Washington and in Japan as members of the family Plotopteridae, but distinct enough from Plotopterum in their general anatomy to warrant their own genus. The Washington fossils, collected by Douglas Emlong in Late Oligocene terrains of the Pysht Formation, in the north of the Olympic Peninsula, were formally described the next year, 1980, by Olson himself, as the type of the new genus and species Tonsala hildegardae. Olson ascribed to the genus the holotype USNM 256518, an incomplete specimen comprising a fragmentary humerus, fragments of a distal wing, a patella and a pectoral girdle. In 1996, while describing Copepteryx, Olson and Hasegawa tentatively assigned a 16.5 cm coracoid from the late Oligocene of Hikoshima, Japan to the genus, much larger than the coracoid of T. hildegardae and almost as long as that of C. hexeris. It was then the first appearance of the genus Tonsala in Japan.  In 2000, James L. Goedert and John Cornish referred to the type species two newly discovered specimens collected respectively in 1984 and 1986 in the lower part of the Pysht Formation, near the type locality of the holotype, and including two pelvis, fragmentary vertebral, forelimb and hindlimb remains, and portions of the dentary. In 2011, Gareth J. Dyke, Xia Wang and Michael B. Habib proposed a new species based on Oligocene fossils found in the Pysht Formation and the underlying Makah Formation, Tonsala buchanani. 

In 2015, three new specimens, including two additional cranial remains, of Tonsala hildegardae, collected respectively in 1985, 1989 and 2008 by James L. Goedert in Oligocene sediments from the Pysht Formation, were described by Gerald Mayr, Goedert and Olaf Vogel.

In 2016, Mayr and Goedert referred two additional specimens from the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene of the Jansen Creek Member of the Makah Formation to the genus Tonsala, including one partial pelvis collected in 2004 by Goedert, tentatively assigned to T. hildegardae, and a right coracoid collected in 2009 by D. W. Starr tentatively referred to the genus as ?Tonsala sp., and suggested that T. buchanani represented more than one species and had been incorrectly attributed to the genus Tonsala.

In 2017, Mayr and Goedert used Tonsala as the type genus of the new clade Tonsalinae, comprising all derived Plotopterids, aside from the primitive and fragmentary Phocavis and the small-sized Stemec and Plotopterum ; they additionally referred to the genus, as a new specimen of T. hildegardae, a partial skeleton including most notably the first known tarsometatarsus assigned to the genus.

In 2019, the Japanese remains assigned tentatively to a new species of Tonsala by Olson and Hasegawa in 1996 were redescribed and assigned to a new genus and species, Stenornis kanmonensis

In 2021, T. buchanani was moved to the genus Klallamornis by Mayr and Goedert, as K. buchanani, becoming the new type species of the genus. Additionally, criticism were drown towards Dyke et al, 2016, leading to a reevaluation of the specimens assigned to Tonsala ; one of the partial skeletons referred to the type species by Dyke et al. was only tentatively referred by Mayr and Goedert, as cf. Tonsala hildegardae.

===Etymology===

The genus name, Tonsala, is constructed with the Latin prefix "Tonsa-", meaning "oar", and the suffix "-ala", meaning wing, referencing the adaptation of its forelimbs as a swimming apparatus ; the species name, hildegardae, was given to honour Hildegarde Howard, the American paleontologist who described Plotopterum.

==Description==

Tonsala hildegardae was a large and flightless seabird, comparable in size with a great penguin, and larger than its later relative Plotopterum. Its relatively slender femur tends to indicate that it was the sister taxa of a group including all plotopterids, aside from Phocavis and Plotopterum ; it has been suggested that Phocavis maritimus may be synonymous with Tonsala hildegardae.

The genus was heavily adapted towards swimming and diving ; the wings were paddle-shaped, and the scapula had a thin and expanded blade, similar to that of penguins, to help the animal propel through water. The structure of the wing, and notably the shape of the humerus and radius, shared more resemblances with early penguins and flightless auks like Pinguinus and Mancalla than with the related Pelecaniformes, in a case of convergent evolution. The appearance of the ulnare also indicates the relatively low flexibility of the distal region of the wings. The ulna itself shared similarities with the unrelated Paleocene penguin Waimanu. However, the genus retains some pelecaniform characteristics, such as an elongated acromion on the scapula, although thinner than its modern relatives, and the distinctive plotopterid coracoid was similar to those of gannets, while the ossified patella, only element known about the hindlimbs of the genus, was more reminiscent of darters. Aside of its larger size, it is differentiated from Plotopterum through the more elongated glenoid facet, the lack of sinuation on the sternal margin, the projection of the furcular facet and the long and narrow coracohumeral surface.  Its femur was much larger than that of Plotopterum, and smaller and more elongated than that of Copepteryx and Hokkaidornis. The pelvis of Tonsala was broad and shallow, more elongated than that of Copepteryx, and reduced in its caudal portion; it shared similarities with the pelvis of modern darters, and was characterized by an elongated praeacetabular portion, twice as large than the postacetabular portion. The tibiotarsus was slender than that of Copepteryx and more elongated than those of modern boobies and gannets. The caudal vertebrae were large, twice the size of those of the modern great cormorant. The tarsometatarsus was stouter than that of Phocavis and the hypotarsus had only two developed crests, like in other tonsaline plotopterids. The slanting of the distal articular surfaces of the second and fourth trochleae metatarsorum may be an indication that Tonsala had splayed toes, and possibly webbed feet.

Fossilized skull bones of plotopterids are rare, but the cranium of Tonsala is known from three specimens, including a fragment of the beak associated with postcranial remains and two isolated and poorly preserved skulls comparable in size with the skull of the modern Southern royal albatross and much larger than any extant suliform. The complete beak was presumably proportionally longer than those of its modern relatives, and was opened by elongated and very narrow nostrils, unlike modern Suloids for which the nostrils are greatly reduced or completely absents. The skull was devoid of vomer. The braincase, although badly preserved, was more reminiscent in proportion of those of sulids. The lower mandible was deeply concave and sharing its broadness with modern penguins.

Another undescribed species referred by Mayr and Goedert to the genus as ?Tonsala sp., known from a single right coracoid from the Makah Formation, differs from T. hildegardae mostly by its lesser size.

==Classification==

Plotopterids as a group were always, since the discovery of the holotype specimen of Plotopterum by Hildegarde Howard, considered as related to modern day cormorants, darters and gannets; the exact status of their relationships with modern taxa is however still debated. In 1980, Olson, describing the first remains of Tonsala as member of the clade Sulae, noted that modern members of the Sulidae family were, more than Phalacrocoracidae and Anhingidae, akin to the expected wing-propelled natation practiced by plotopterids, although in 1996 Olson commented, in a paper co-authored with Hasegawa, that Plotopteridae was either the sister-group of the clade formed Anhingidae and Phalacrocoracidae, or that Phalacrocoracidae was the sister-group of Plotopteridae and Anhingidae, with Sulidae being in both cases an outlier within the clade Sulae, today recombined as Suliformes. In 2004, Gerald Mayr tried to introduce an hypothesis on presumed phylogenetic relationships between the plotopterids and the modern penguins, on the basis of ecological and physiological similarities, as well as an attempt to explain the convergent apparition of Spheniscids in the South Pacific and Plotopterids in the North Pacific during the Eocene ; in this hypothesis, Plotopteridae would have been the sister group to Spheniscidae, and their clade would have been the sister clade of modern Suliformes. This hypothesis has since been heavily criticized, and several factors, such as recent progress in molecular DNA analysis in order to study the relationships between extant species, as well as the discovery of the well-preserved, early Spheniscidae Waimanu, that lacked the derived traits present in both modern penguins and plotopterids used to clade them by Mayr, have pushed him to disavow this theory ; most researchers considering today that the evolution of wing-propelled diving in penguins, plotopterids and extinct flightless auks is an example of convergent evolution. In 2015, Mayr came to the conclusion that Plotopteridae, on account of several primitive traits not shared with modern Suloids, was the sister taxa of the clade Suloidea, including all modern gannets, cormorants, boobies and darters, and that the clade formed by Plotopteridae and Suloidea was the sister group of Fregatidae, including the modern frigatebirds.

In 2017, Mayr and Goedert proposed a new clade, Tonsalinae, including Tonsala and all larger plotopterids known at the time from the Pacific Northwest and Japan, aside from the incomplete and primitive Phocavis and the smaller Plotopterum and Stemec, the latter of which presumably clading together. Due to the paucity of well-preserved remains, phylogenetic relationships was inferred based on the absence of a foramen vasculare distale on the tarsometatarsus of Tonsala, making it more similar by to those of larger forms like Copepteryx, Hokkaidornis, Olympidytes and Klallamornis than to those of the smaller forms Stemec and Plotopterum. The tarsometatarsus of Phocavis is not known, and relationships with other plotopterids can hardly been inferred.

Within Tonsalinae, Tonsala was perceived as the most basal member, with, according to Mayr in his 2016 article, two potential phylogenies ; the first of which, considering the eventuality of a single origin in the gigantism of Japanese and American plotopterids, would clade Olympidytes as the sister genus of a clade including the larger-sized Klallamornis of North America, from which the Japanese Copepteryx and Hokkaidornis would eventually descend. Another possibility envisioned by Mayr would be a distinction based on the presence or absence of a notch located on the dorsal surface of the tarsometatarsus by the disappearance of the foramen vasculare discale ; this distinction would leave two sister clades of derived tonsalines, one including the North American genera, for which the notch is still visible, and the other comprising the Japanese genera, in which the notch has completely disappeared. Those considerations were corroborated in his 2017 article, for which he preferred the first hypothesis, based on the size of the tarsometatarsus ; the phylogenetic tree proposed in the article being as follows:

==Palaeoecology==

Although it was much larger than modern cormorants and darters, Tonsala was one of the smallest and the most common plotopterid living alongside the coast of the Pacific Northwest during the Oligocene. In the Pysht Formation, remains of Tonsala hildegardae are found associated with those of primitive cetaceans like the stem-mysticete Borealodon and the Aetiocetidae Fucaia, shorebirds related to the genus Calidris, the Desmostylian Behemotops, and the plotopterids Klallamornis buchanani and K. abyssa. In the Late Eocene to early Oligocene Makah Formation, at least two species of Tonsala coexisted with their relative Klallamornis abyssa, with another undescribed species of smaller plotopterid and with the basal procellariiform Makahala mirae.

The compressed wing elements and the extended scapular blade of Tonsala indicates that it was likely capable of producing wing upstroke movements to propulsate itself in water, with a force comparable to that of modern penguins, and proportionally stronger than that produced by its smaller distant relative Plotopterum. The enlarged patella present in the hindlimbs of Tonsala indicates that plotopterid assumed an upright posture on land, like modern penguins and cormorants. Tonsaline plotopterids have been recovered in deep sea deposits from both coasts of the North Pacific, and it is assumed that they were pelagic foragers. They may have nested in offshore volcanic islands, where they could raise their young sheltered from the diversifying mammalian predators.

Based on two fragmentary skeletons of plotopterids, including one of Tonsala, it has been demonstrated that the bone-eating detritivorous worm Osedax, today specialized in the consumption of Cetacean corpses, used to have a more diverse diet and to also be able to feed on the remains of large marine birds. Cow sharks teeth have also been recovered in association with Tonsala remains, suggesting they also fed on the carcasses of plotopterids.

The extinction of Tonsala, alongside that of all of the plotopterids from the Pacific Northwest during the Late Oligocene can be explained by a combination of factors, including the disappearance of the numerous offshore volcanic islands present along the Cascadian coast and presumably used for nidification, the warming of the oceans leading to a dwindling of the native food ressources, and the apparition in North Pacific marine environments of early pinnipeds like Enaliarctos, that may have competed with plotopterids for food, breeding sites, and preyed upon them.

[[Tokrau]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Kazakhstan, Balkhash-Alakol Basin

The Tokrau (Тоқырау) is a river in Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan. It has a length of 298 and a drainage basin of 21100.

The Tokrau flows by Aktogay, the administrative center of Aktogay District, Karaganda Region, as well as by Saryterek village. Its mouth lies northeast of Balkhash City and east of the Bektauata range. The Egizkoytas burial complex of the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age is located in the upper course of the river.

The Tokrau Formation, a fossiliferous stratigraphic unit in Kazakhastan whose strata date back to the Paleozoic, was named after the river.

==Course==

The Tokrau river originates in the Kyzyltas range of the southern Kazakh Uplands, 10 to the north of Mt Karashoki. It heads roughly southwards within a narrow channel all along its course. Its valley may reach 10 in its widest places, narrowing to 75 in gorges. The floodplain is between 1 and 1.2 wide. About 50 away from the coast of Lake Balkhash to the south, the river fans out into many arms in a dry, widening plain. Finally its waters disperse in the semidesert sands to the north of the lakeshore. This last stretch of the Tokrau was an ancient delta dating back to the time when the river reached Lake Balkhash.

The Tokrau is fed mainly by winter snows. Its water is fresh and the river channel fills between March and May, although less often it may fill in late autumn too. The lower stretch frequently dries up, stagnating into disconnected pools. Very rarely, in years of abundant spring floods, the waters of the river may break through the desert area and trickle into lake Balkhash.

===Tributaries===

The main tributaries of the Tokrau are the Zhalanash, the 73 long Karamende, the Kosabai, the Karatal and the 65 long Zhinishke.

[[Roshan-ud-Daulah]]

CATEGORIES: Grand viziers of the Mughal Empire

Roshan-ud-Daulah's original name was Khwaja Muzaffar Panipati, who was given the title Turra-i-Baz Roshan-ud-Daulah Zafar Khan. He was the Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Muhammad Shah. He was known by the nickname Turra-i-Baz(falcon's crest) as Roshan-ud-Daula and all his men wore their turbans in the same way, with an end sticking out.

==Biography==

Roshan-ud-Daulah was an Indian Muslim descendant of the Naqshbandi Khwajas, and was a native of Panipat. His father, Khwaja Fathullah, was married to the sister of Sarbuland Khan, a Sayyid who was the Mir Bakhshi of Aurangzeb. His ancestors gained positions in the time of Aurangzeb as the religious mentality had turned in favour of the Naqshbandis and the seeds of Ahmad Sirhindi's teachings had grown both in the subcontinent and central asia.

In the reign of Farrukhsiyar, he replaced Khan-i Dauran in charge of the duties as the deputy Bakhshi of Ihtisham-ul-Mulk Barha the Mir Bakhshi, one of the Sayyid Brothers. He was part of Hussain Khan Barha's campaign against Ajit Singh and returned to court with the news of Ajit Singh's submission on May 1714, being rewarded with the title Fidwi-i-Farmanbardar. His daughter was married to the son of the Asaf Jah I, which was celebrated at Aurangabad. Another daughter was married to Banda Ali Khan, the daughter's son of Sher Afkan Panipati, the son of Abdur Razzaq Ansari. In 1718 he was the Bakhshi of the Ahadis, the personal guard cavalry of the Emperor Farrukhsiyar. He was friendly to the Sayyids, while at the same time professed to be zealous for the Emperor. He made all efforts he could to bring both parties to an agreement.

In the reign of Muhammad Shah, he was appointed Wazir succeeding Qamar-ud-Din, as Muhammad Shah resolved to break the power of the "Chin" group of nobles and had dismissed Qamar-ud-Din from Wizarat. Zafar Khan was the most powerful noble in Muhammad Shah's court, and part of the king's intimate circle of nobles along with Shah Abdul Ghafur of Thatta. According to Ashob, like Khan-i Dauran, Ashob considered himself an Indian Muslim, and his armed retinue and following consisted almost exclusively of Indian Muslims. Although he was a Hindustani, he formed his own faction with Sher Afkan Khan(brother of Lutfullah Khan Panipati), and did not side with the Indian Muslim Amir-ul-Umara, Khan-i-Dauran. He was related by marriage to the Nizam of Hyderabad, but did not side with him against Khan-i-Dauran. The new Wazir Roshan-ud-Daulah was disgusted at the dilly-dally approach of Muhammad Shah and his neglect in official duties. However, Zafar Khan was also a corrupt official. Ashob states that Roshan-ud-Daulah had amassed more wealth than what the Pharaoh dreamed to possess, writing that Zafar Khan's house looked like a mountain of gold, and that it appeared as if streams of gold were flowing from productive lands of the empire into the villas of the nobles. He was later found guilty of misappropriation of funds and was dismissed from his post, after he was accused of corruption by the Amir-ul-Umara, Khan-i Dauran. along with his brother Fakhr-ud-Daula, the governor of Bihar. It is said that Muhammad Shah had also been suspicious of Roshan-ud-Daulah for his marriage alliance with the Nizam in the Deccan, which also contributed to his downfall. The faction of Roshan-ud-Daulah was supplanted by the clique of Khan-i-Dauran Samsam-ud-Daulah and his brother Muzaffar Khan until their deaths at 1739.

==Works==

Roshan-ud-Daulah was known for the construction of the Sunehri Masjid in the Chandni Chowk in Dehli, which he built for the local Sufi Saint, Shah Bik, of whom he was a disciple. The Sunehri mosque is a place of interest as it was here that Nader Shah ordered a massacre in Delhi. As a governor of the region of Saharanpur, Roshan-ud-Daulah also donated the Ambehta to his Pir Shah Muhammad Baqir, a son of Shah Abdul Maali, whose descendants still retain their ancestral property. He celebrated Mawlid, the anniversary of the Prophet, "on a grand scale...everyday he sent abundant supplies of various preparations such as Pulao and Sheer Birunj(milk dressed in rice) during the entire period of the festivities." He spent vast sums during the Urs ceremony at the Dargah of the Chishti saint, Bakhtiyar Kaki, in Mehrauli of south Delhi. He provided elaborate lighting devices along the 15 km road that led to the Dargah from the imperial palace at Dehli. The Emperor, his mother, and ladies of the Harem sat at the Lahori gate of the Fort, enjoyed the scene of illumination, and before midnight retired to their apartments. Once a week Roshan-ud-Daula held the Majlis-i-Sama to which he invited a large number of mystics, saints, 'Ulama and pious persons of the city. In a state of ecstasy he tore up his golden clothes and distributed the pieces among the singers, besides offering gold and silver coins to them. When the music was over, the gathering was entertained with sumptuous meals consisting of several dishes in gold and silver wares.

==Relatives==

His brother, Fakhr-ud-Daulah was governor of Kashmir and Bihar, until he was sacked from his posts. He was reinstated as governor of Kashmir by Nader Shah.

Ferdy Sambo ('; born 9 February 1973) is a former high-ranking Indonesian National Police officer who last served as the Head of the Profession and Security Division of the Indonesian National Police with the rank of Inspector General of Police. He is known for his involvement in the murder of his aide-de-camp, Nofriansyah Yosua Hutabarat. He was described as the "mastermind" of the killing, in which Hutabarat was shot 12 times with a Glock 17.

On 13 February 2023, following a three month trial at the South Jakarta District Court, Sambo was found guilty and sentenced to death. On 15 February 2023, Sambo filed an appeal against his sentence, two days after his conviction. However, on 12 April 2023, the South Jakarta District Court rejected the appeal, upholding the original sentence. As a result, Sambo's execution was set to proceed as planned. However, in May 2023, Sambo filed a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court of Indonesia, and on 8 August 2023 his sentence was commuted to one of life imprisonment.

==Early life==

Ferdy Sambo was born on 9 February 1973, in Barru, South Sulawesi to William Sambo. His brother is Leonardo Sambo (born 2 June 1971). He went to SMPN 6 Makassar, where he met his future wife, Putri Candrawati. After completing high school, Sambo attended the police academy where he graduated in 1994.

==Personal life==

Sambo married Putri Candrawati (born 1973) on 7 July 2000, who previously had a career as a dentist. The couple had four children named Trisha Eungelica Ardyadana (born 2001), Yakobus Jacki Uly (born 2005), Adrianus Sooai (born 2007), and Arka. During his trial, it was revealed that his youngest child was adopted.

There has been controversy surrounding his wealth, with the public wondering how he owns various luxury cars and owns several properties across the country despite the salary for police generals in Indonesia.

==Career==

His career in the police was fairly successful, especially in the field of detectives, after he was promoted from Head of Criminal Investigation Unit of West Jakarta Police to Chief of Police of Purbalingga in Central Java in 2012. Before serving as the Head of the Propam Police Division, Sambo was the Dirtipidum of the Criminal Investigation Unit of the police.

==Murder of Brigadier Yosua==

Brigadier Nofriansyah Yosua Hutabarat was shot at the Jakarta home of Ferdy Sambo on 8 July 2022 at approximately 17:00 Western Indonesian Time. Hutabarat, a bodyguard and driver for Sambo, was said to have died after a shootout with another member of the protection team, Second Patrolman Richard Eliezer Pudihang Lumiu, allegedly after Hutabarat sexually harassed Sambo's wife, Putri Candrawati. After the shooting, Hutabarat was transported by ambulance to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, though news of the shooting was delayed until 11 July 2022.

On 9 August 2022, Sambo was taken into custody and charged with premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty or life imprisonment. It was later alleged that patrolman Lumiu had been promised immunity from prosecution by Sambo if he followed through with Sambo's version of the shooting. Despite the assurance of Sambo, Lumiu continued to be the sole suspect for the murder, prompting Lumiu to provide the police with a more accurate and open testimony that contradicted Sambo's version of the event.

Head of Indonesian police, General Listyo Sigit Prabowo told a press conference that Sambo had fired multiple pistol shots into a wall in an attempt to show a gunfight had led to Hutabarat's death; there had been no shoot-out and that Sambo had orchestrated Hutabarat's murder. He was described as the "mastermind" of the killing, in which Hutabarat was shot 12 times with a Glock 17.

==Trial==

The murder trial of Ferdy Sambo, his wife, two police officers and a driver – all facing charges of premeditated murder – started in South Jakarta District Court on 17 October 2022. Sambo was accused of ordering a subordinate to shoot Hutabarat, then shooting the wounded victim again himself to kill him. In parallel with the murder trial, seven former officers including Sambo were tried on charges of obstruction of justice related to alleged cover-ups and destruction of evidence.

In January 2023, the court rejected allegations that Hutabarat had raped, sexually assaulted or had an adulterous affair with Sambo's wife, Putri Candrawathi. Prosecutors said Candrawathi had invented a story that she had been raped by Hutabarat, and had repeatedly changed her version of events leading up to the shooting.

On 13 February 2023, Ferdy Sambo was found "legally and convincingly guilty" of the premeditated murder of Hutabarat and sentenced to death – a penalty usually carried out in Indonesia by firing squad. Verdicts and sentences regarding Candrawathi and the three other accused followed later in the week. Sambo has a week to appeal the verdict; his role as a law enforcer was seen by observers as a factor in the court imposing the maximum sentence – Ardi Manto Saputra, deputy director of human rights group Imparsial said Sambo had "tainted the reputation of law enforcement and the government's dignity".

Candrawathi received a 20-years prison sentence for her role in the murder; her personal assistant Kuat Ma'ruf was given 15 years, and Ricky Rizal Wibowo was given a 13-year sentence (in all three cases, the prosecution had requested eight-year terms). On 15 February 2023, Richard Eliezer Pudihang Lumiu was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the murder; the prosecution had requested a twelve-year term but he was given a lighter sentence for his efforts as a justice collaborator.

On 15 and 16 February 2023, lawyers for four defendants (Ma'ruf, Sambo, Candrawathi and Rizal) submitted appeals against their sentences; prosecutors lodged counter-appeals. On 12 April 2023, the South Jakarta District Court rejected all of the defendants' appeals, though the defendants can still appeal to the Supreme Court or seek clemency from the president. In May 2023, Sambo, Chandrawati and Ma'ruf filed cassation appeals to the Supreme Court.

On 8 August 2023, Sambo's appeal was granted by the Supreme Court on a majority decision (3-2), thereby reducing his sentence to one of life imprisonment. The Supreme Court also halved Candrawathi's prison sentence to 10 years, Ma’ruf's sentence was cut from 15 to 10 years, while Rizal's sentence was reduced from 13 to eight years.

"Willing to Trust" is a song by American musicians Kid Cudi and Ty Dolla Sign. It was released on September 23, 2022, as the second single from Cudi’s eighth studio album, Entergalactic (2022). The lyrics were handled by Cudi and Ty Dolla Sign, while the music was written and produced by Cudi, alongside Dot da Genius, E. Vax and Ramii. 

The song was also featured in Cudi’s adult animated TV special Entergalactic (2022), which Cudi and Ty Dolla Sign both star in. The song won the award for Original Song – TV Movie Streamed at the 13th Hollywood Music in Media Awards.

==Background==

When speaking on the song with Billboard, Cudi said “It’s a song that’s a big moment in the show. It’s a tender moment and the beat is crazy. Ty Dolla $ign does his f–king thing on there and he’s really amazing. It’s a really beautiful song from beginning to end. It’s a perfect love song.”

The song marks the third collaboration between Cudi and Ty Dolla Sign, previously working together on "Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)" from Kids See Ghosts (2018) and on "Temptations" from Featuring Ty Dolla Sign (2020).

==Release and composition==

The song was released in promotion for the album and TV special of the same name, for streaming and digital download on September 23, 2022. "Willing to Trust" runs for a duration of four minutes and 42 seconds. Rolling Stone called the song a "characteristically woozy Kid Cudi cut, anchored by deep bass grooves, awash with heavy synths, and sprinkled with some spaced-out guitar riffs. Cudi and Ty trade off vocal duties on the verses before linking up on the simple, yet affecting refrain." The song bears elements of contemporary R&B and neo soul.

==Reception==

Nick Polak of Atwood Magazine gave a positive review, when he wrote “addictive on first listen, ‘Willing to Trust’ is a foray into a hidden part of Kid Cudi’s life as he presents his candid feelings about love over a soothing bass and harmonious backing vocals.”

==Live performances==

On September 28, 2022, Cudi appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where he was interviewed to promote the album and TV special, during the show he also performed the single "Willing to Trust" alongside Ty Dolla Sign.

CATEGORIES: 1889 establishments in the Dutch East Indies, Defunct town tramway systems by city, Tram transport in Indonesia, Transport in Surabaya

There was a tram system in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia from 1889 to 1978. The tramway was operated by a private company Oost-Java Stoomtram Maatschappij (OJS, "East Java Steam Tram Company"), and later by Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI), and was the only OJS-owned rail system survived in post-independence Indonesia. The tramway linked Ujung (Port of Tanjung Perak) with Wonokromo and continued towards Krian in Sidoarjo. All land assets of the tramway is currently owned by Operational Area VII Surabaya of the KAI.

==History==

As the initial capital of the company, the OJS started to build a steam-powered tram line in Surabaya in 1889. The first section, Ujung–Fort Prins Hendrik, was inaugurated in 10 December 1889. The line mostly runs along the banks of Mas River.

In early 20th century, the OJS was interested in the Bataviasche Elektrische Tram Maatschappij (BETM) success in developing electric trams in Batavia. To prepare for electric tram installation, in 1911 the OJS expanded its network so that almost the entire city of Surabaya was connected by tram lines. It reached 36 kilometers of length as of 1924. The electric tram system was officially opened in 15 May 1923.

During expansion, the main line was completely overhauled; the route that previously passed through the banks of Mas River was diverted through the city center, running past Pasar Turi and Sawahan and followed Darmo Street in the city center. Other lines built are the Simpang–Wonokromo Kota, Simpang–Gubeng, Tunjungan–Sawahan, and Simpang–Kalimas. To support tram maintenance, a tram depot and a power plant were also built in Sawahan. However, during the Japanese occupation the Karangpilang–Krian OJS section was finally scrapped by Japanese rōmusha workers along with all OJS lines outside Surabaya. Although the tram stop names were recorded in the data, they were unable to save the tracks and stops from their dismantling.

The tram network was nationalized and operated by DKARI (currently KAI) in 1949. The electric tramway was dismantled in late 1960s, and the remaining steam tramway was finally closed in 1978.

These are the tramway sections in Surabaya according to the book Buku Jarak Antarstasiun dan Perhentian by the KAI.

The McAllen Packers were a minor league baseball franchise based in McAllen, Texas. In 1938, the Packers played as members of the Class D level Texas Valley League, hosting home games at Legion Park.

==History==

The Packers were preceded by the 1931 McAllen Palms, who played one season as members of the Class D level Rio Grande Valley League, winning the league championship in a shortened season, as the league folded following the season.

The McAllen "Packers" began minor league play as members of the 1938 Texas Valley League. After a nine–season hiatus, the Texas Valley League reformed as a six–team Class D level league, with the Brownsville Charros, Corpus Christi Spudders, Harlingen Hubs, Refugio Oilers and Taft Cardinals joining McAllen as league members, beginning play on April 14, 1938.

The "Packers" nickname ties to the local agriculture industry in McAllen and the surrounding region. In the era, numerous packing facilities were in operation to pack produce for distribution to other regions.

The Packers finished the regular season in fifth place in the overall final standings. During the season, the Texas Valley League adopted a split–season schedule. McAllen was in fifth place with a 28–40 record on June 24, 1938, in the final first–half standings, following first place Corpus Christi, second place Harlingen, third place Taft and fourth place Refugio.

McAllen placed fifth and ended the 1938 regular season with an overall record of 65–72, playing the season under managers Ray Friday and Wally Kopp. The Packers finished 27.5 games behind the first place Corpus Christi Spudders in the final regular season standings. McAllen did not qualify 1938 four–team Texas Valley League playoffs.

The final Texas Valley League regular season standings were led by the Corpus Christi Spudders (92–44), who finished 8.5 games ahead of the second place Harlingen Hubs (84–53), with Taft (68–67) and Refugio (67–67) finishing in third place and fourth place to qualify for the four–team playoffs. Corpus Christi had won the first-half of the split–season schedule and tied with Harlingen for the second–half championship. The McAllen Packers (65–72) and Brownsville Charros (30–103) finished in fifth and sixth place, missing the playoffs. In the league finals, Harlingen defeated Corpus Christi to win the title. Both Harlingen (Detroit Tigers) and Corpus Christi (St. Louis Browns) were major league affiliate teams, the only two affiliated teams in the league.

Following the 1938 season, the Texas Valley League permanently folded. McAllen next hosted minor league baseball, with the 1949 McAllen Giants, who resumed play in the Class D level Rio Grande Valley League.

Nicola "Nick" Nero (born 1977) is a Canadian gangster currently serving a life sentence for murder. Nero served as one of the leaders of the Wolfpack Alliance and was briefly one of Canada's most successful cocaine smugglers.

==Entry into crime==

Nero was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario into an Italian-Canadian family. Nero was described by one high school classmate as "dumb as a bag of hair", but very ambitious and full of rage. Nero took to bodybuilding and steroid abuse as a teenager as it was his ambition to become a professional wrestler, whose ring-name was to be "Iron Man". Nero's steroid abuse caused him to have massive muscles and a raspy voice while excessive use of a tanning salon caused his skin to take a peculiar orange tinge. At the age of 18, he spent $3, 500 to study professional wrestling at a warehouse in Hamilton.

Nero told the reporter Wade Hemsworth of The Hamilton Spectator that he could bench-press 600 pounds and spoke of his desire to be Canada's greatest professional wrestler. Hemsworth wrote: "He's 5 foot 8, weights 278 pounds and has a chest big enough that you can rest a dinner plate on". He told Hemsworth: "I like bodybuilding, but it was kind of boring. You just go into shows. I want to be an athlete, not just a guy who works out". In 2003, Nero placed 7th in the super-heavyweight division of the Canadian Bodybuilder Federation's championships.

On the night of 11 December 2003, Nero took part in a robbery in Toronto where $3 million in cash were taken from an armored car. The driver of the armored car, Joseph Bruni, was involved in the robbery and opened the back door of the armored car, which allowed Nero and Michele "Mike" Stante to take the bags of cash. Nero was convicted of theft, but his share of the robbery, namely $1 million, was never recovered. Nero used his robbery proceeds to enter the cocaine smuggling business in partnership with a Hells Angel, Zavisa "Zav" Drecic. In 2007, Nero was arrested while living on bail after the Hells Angel-turned-police informer, David Atwell, recorded Drecic buying GHB, the so-called "date rape" drug while Atwell recorded Nero buying cocaine from him. Nero was convicted in 2007 of trafficking in 9 kilograms of cocaine, 2 kilograms of hashish, 340 oxycodone pills, 200 Viagra pills and 468 liter of GHB on the basis of what Atwell's wire recorded Nero buying from him in 2005 and 2006. The fact that Nero refused the Crown's offers of a plea bargain where he would testify against his Hells Angels associates improved his reputation in the underworld as someone who could be trusted not to turn informer. After his convictions for drug trafficking and robbery in May 2007, Nero met in prison, a Mafiosi, Pietro Scarcella, and went into business with him. Scarcella had been nearly killed by another prisoner who stabbed him half dozen times with a homemade knife in an attempted "jailhouse hit" in April 2007 and he was afraid for his life. Nero, a tall man with budging muscles served as his bodyguard. Scarcella when he applied for parole in 2007 and 2007 asked to be placed in the Niagara area, which would place him close to Nero.

In 2009, Nero appealed for parole, telling the parole board amid his tears that he was deeply sorry for his crimes as stated: "My life has been destroyed with this, this product cocaine. I don't even know how to describe it. This destroyed my family...I chose to profit from something that destroyed my family...I want to pay my debt to society. I want to do my time. I want to go out and I want to raise my family well...Cocaine destroyed my family. There is no need to destroy other families." The parole board agreed to his release, but did not grant him full parole as he wanted as he still refused to return the $1 million stolen in 2003. Nero's parole conditions stated he was not to own a cellphone or a pager; provide his parole officer with a monthly statement of his income and debts; not to associate with anyone with a criminal record; and "refrain from the purchase, possession or consumption of medicines without a prescription". The Canadian journalist Peter Edwards and the Mexican journalist Luis Nájera wrote that Nero immediately went about violating all of his parole conditions after his release on 3 November 2009. A lien was imposed on Nero ordering him to repay the $1 million he had stolen, which he avoided by refusing to take legitimate employment.

==The Wolfpack==

After his release on day parole in November 2009, Nero started to work with one of Scarcella's associates, Martino Caputo, the Toronto agent for the Rizzuto family of Montreal. Nero's request to join the Mafia was refused under the grounds that he was a "heat score" (slang for a criminal who attracts police attention), but Caputo went into business with him. Edwards and Nájera wrote that Caputo was among the "crėme de le crėme" of  Mafiosi in Toronto who had greater authority to act as the Rizzuto family in Montreal was plunged into bloody in-fighting. Caputo joined the Wolfpack because he wanted to buy cocaine from the Sinaloa Cartel directly.

Nero was in charge of smuggling cocaine into the Niagara Peninsula from Buffalo, New York as part of the Wolfpack Alliance. Rabih "Robby" Alkhalil of Montreal recruited Nero into the Wolfpack despite viewing him as being of low intelligence as he felt Nero's connections with the Hells Angels would be useful. The Wolfpack leaders used encrypted texts on the Pretty Good Privacy system to communicate, and wrote frankly about plans to commit crimes. Nero made an average profit of CA$1 million in cash for every 30 kilograms of cocaine he sold, which made him a wealthy man, through he always felt he was not making enough money. His steroid abuse made his moods very volatile and his paranoia and rage issues made him a difficult member of the Wolfpack. Nero had become of the most important cocaine smugglers in Canada, bringing in an average of 400 kilograms of cocaine per week into the Niagara Peninsula via boats and trucks. Despite his profits, Nero still refused to repay the $1 million lien, claiming poverty under the grounds that he was unemployed.

In 2011, Nero had met Tawnya Del Ben Fletcher, a young woman from a wealthy family at a gym in Niagara Falls and started to date her. Fletcher's father owned a popular hotel. In October 2011, Nero became engaged to Fletcher, a much younger woman at the age of 27 with an MBA who turned down admission to a medical school in Australia to live with him. Besides for her MBA, Fletcher was awarded in 2006 an honours Bachelor of Science degree from McGill University. To impress her, Nero traded in his Ferrari F340 for a Ferrari F458 automobile worth $450,000, and later purchased a third car, a Lamborghini Aventador. At the same time, Caputo started to date Tamara Fletcher, the identical twin sister of Tawnya.

Nero lived in a  St. Catharines half-way house from Sunday to Thursday and a place of his choosing on Fridays and Saturdays per his parole conditions. While out on his weekend passes Nero lived in a condo in Niagara-on-the-Lake owned by Fletcher, but lied to the parole board by bribing a former girlfriend to say he was living with her in Toronto while he was out on his weekend passes. Nero never admitted his relationship with Fletcher to the parole board, which reflected his tendency to hide as much as possible about what he was doing from the parole board. Fletcher had purchased the lakefront condo in Niagara-on-the-Lake from Caputo's brother, Antonio, in 2011 at a price significantly lower than the market price.  Through he did not live in Toronto during his weekend passes as he claimed, Nero frequently visited Toronto in the company of Caputo, where the two men were often seen in the Little Italy neighborhood on College Street.

Nero attracted attention at the half-way house he was lived in during 2011-2012 by driving either his Ferrari or Maserati automobiles. As Nero had no job, his choice of transportation was considered very suspicious by the police. Several of the other residents of the half-way house-who were jealous of Nero's way of flaunting his wealth-reported him to the police, saying he was living well beyond the means of an unemployed man. The police took an interest in the way that Nero who lived on welfare drove about his bright red Ferrari F430 automobile, leading one policeman to say of Nero: "It just screamed stupidity. You can't fix stupid". Another policeman noted that Nero modelled himself after the Jimmy "the Gent" Conway character played by Robert De Niro in the 1990 film Goodfellas, saying: "He thinks he's Robert De Niro in the movies". Nero had plans to expand his cocaine distribution business into Europe, developing a network of contacts in Germany and Greece with the aim of becoming Europe's top cocaine distributor. Nero's neighbors in the Niagara-on-the-Lake condo described him as an unfriendly and unpleasant man. The neighbors reported that both Fletcher and Nero "kept to themselves".

The police suspected that Nero did not intend to abide by his parole conditions as he violated his bail conditions. The police started an investigation of Nero dubbed Project Ink. In February 2012, the police seized 110 kilograms of cocaine worth $30 million from a warehouse in St. Catharines, which the police knew belonged to Nero. The police wiretaps of Fletcher's condo that she shared with Nero revealed that Fletcher was the more intelligent of the couple as she tried hard to assist her fiancée with becoming a successful gangster, using her business acumen. The police wiretaps showed that Nero's intelligence level constantly exasperated her. On the evening of 24 April 2012, she was recorded by the police wiretap shouting at her fiancée: "You just waste so much frickin' time and money you know". Nero stated he needed time to discuss matters with the Sinaloa Cartel more, which led her to she  "why?" In response Nero stated "I don't understand what's going on". When she suggested that internal theft of cocaine that was so troubling him might be reduced by paying his workers more as she noted that his workers were had an annual income of only $30,000—which made stealing his cocaine very tempting-Nero vetoed that suggestion under the grounds it would mean less money for himself. Despite her later claims to only play a passive role in the Wolfpack, the police bugs inside their condo recorded Fletecher and Nero engaged in frequent conversations about how to discover internal theft in the smuggling  ring as both were convinced that someone was stealing the cocaine on its way up from Mexico.

At one point, a police bug recorded Fletcher telling Nero: "I don't know how normal people afford life". Nero agreed with her as he expressed his utter contempt for people who lived honestly as "deadbeats" and told Fletcher that she was lucky to be engaged to a gangster who lived dishonestly and committed the "extra special" crimes that allowed her to live the lavish lifestyle that he told her that she deserved. Fletcher agreed with that statement and then started to talk about having children, which she clearly wanted. Fletcher only half-joking stated that any child that Nero might father by her would be a moronic "devil child". In March 2012, Caputo ordered Nero to stop driving his Ferrari and Maserati, saying he was attracting too much attention, forcing Nero to reluctantly drive a 2001 Yukon Denali SUV. Nero who was very status-conscious, was deeply humiliated by the order, as the police wiretaps recorded Nero cursing his Yukon Denali as a vehicle unworthy of him and expressing the desire to show off by driving either his Ferrari or Maserati again.

One of Nero's Wolfpack associates was a Croat immigrant, Nebojsa Dronjak, the director of a luxury automobile dealership in Port Robinson turned cocaine dealer. Nero was a frequent customer at Dronjak's dealership and joined the Wolfpack after Nero boasted to him about the profits to be made via smuggling cocaine. The friendship between Dronjak and Nero proved to be facile. Dronjak took to taunting Nero via his texts, at one point telling him that a group of Mafia leaders had met in Montreal to discuss him, which clearly aggravated Nero. In one text, Dronjak wrote: "What's the sitdown in mtl Montreal? I hear it ruled against you wtf is this Mafia movies now lol!". In response, Nero wrote: "WHAT???" Dronjak replied: "I dunno know story in the falls Falls that there was a sitdown in mtl little guy Caputo went and that it was ruled against you bro???"" Nero was thrown into a state of hysteria by Dronjak's claims, all the more so as Dronjak's story suggested that his mentor Caputo had turned against him, and only finally calmed down when he learned that Dronjak was just teasing him. Despite his claims of friendship, Dronjak seemed to take a sadistic pleasure in telling Nero's misinformation designed to work him up into fear and rage.

In response, Nero texted back to Dronjak: "No I wasn't invited. Who ever is talking about me better shut up or I will fucking smash them in the face. Loosers Losers!" Nero seemed to think that he was the victim of a plot by drug addict drug dealers. As Dronjak continued to tease him about the supposed Montreal meeting, Nero finally snapped as he texted: "We all responcble responsible for our own losses. Real men come forward and say yes I'm responcble responsible. They are goofs they own the balance. Simple. They can go to all the sits down they want. I will smash them all I don't care. They doing to so it gets back to coppers. I don't care who they lie to and make themselves look like victims. They know they are wrong. I sat with them. I told them they are responble responsible for 27. I will give them work to work it off. They said ok. Now they run for help. I don't care why they cry too to wrong is wrong who ever condones this is a goof too! I'm not scared of these junkie goofs. They not like us bro. We are real. U you said don't worry bro let' make it back. We are there for eachother other. A real man. They are goofs". The word "goof" is considered to be the worse insult in the Canadian underworld and Nero's use of the word "goof" was meant to disparage his supposed enemies. Edwards and Najera wrote: "There's is no bigger insult in the underworld than calling someone a goof. It's a prison term for informers, child molesters and anyone else on the absolute bottom tier of their sharply stratified hierarchy".

Despite his work as a cocaine smuggler, Nero admitted to Fletcher that he did not know how to test the purity of the cocaine he was buying from the Sinaloa Cartel and thus had no idea if he was being cheated. Nero imported cocaine from Mexico that was supposed to be 98% pure, for which he paid a premium price.  Nero also told Fletcher he was too afraid to admit to the other Wolfpack members his ignorance of chemistry out of the fear of appearing stupid. The cocaine testers send down to Mexico by Amero and Alkhalil reported that the cocaine that Nero was buying that was supposed to 98% pure was in fact only 38% pure. Nero was recorded telling Fletcher he was very confused about why he had to pay 15% charge on wiring money to Mexico and a 16% charge on receiving money from Mexico, admitting he did not understand, which worked him up to a state of steroid-induced rage as usually happened when he was faced with a situation that was beyond his understanding. Nero had plans to import $2 billion worth of cocaine into Canada per year as he told Fletcher that he wanted to be the biggest cocaine dealer in Canada. Nero constantly accused other members of the Wolfpack and the Sinaloa Cartel of cheating him, making accusations of diluting the cocaine he was buying, which vexed his business partners to no end, all the more so as Nero had no proof for his accusations. Alkhalil accused Nero of gratuitously straining relations with the Sinaloa Cartel and only seemed to tolerate him because he was one of the top drug smugglers in the Niagara Peninsula.

In one of his texts, Nero wrote to the car dealer-turned-drug dealer Alfonso "Al" Inclima on 2 May 2012 that the Air Canada airline was deeply corrupt and it was possible for the Wolfpack to smuggle a shipment of cocaine worth CA$750,000 via Air Canada per week into Toronto. On the same day, Nero received forty-five kilograms of cocaine from Mexico and discovered much to his surprise that 13 kilograms of the shipment were in baking soda and white flour with a minuscule amount of cocaine mixed in. Nero discovered that the Sinaloa Cartel often shipped white bricks designed to look like cocaine as a way to test the competence of the smugglers and much to his fury learned that Sinaloa Cartel would not refund him for the 13 kilograms he paid for that were in fact baking soda. When Inclima indicated that it was possible to smuggle cocaine into Argentina, Nero exploded in rage at him, texting him: "Bro!!! U you are suppose to resolve things and get answers and confirm dates. I'm more confused now!!!!!" When Inclima failed to respond, Nero texted him: "What the fuck is the answer bro? Now! What the fuck are you doing there!!! I am still owed pieces. When am I getting them?"

Later on the same day, Nero-after having calmed down- texted Inclima : "Do they have british airways? We get 4000 pds pounds in uk Kingdom per". The profit from selling cocaine in the United Kingdom were US$64,000 per kilogram, which were double the profits from selling cocaine in Toronto, which made Nero very keen on his British expansion plans. Inclima texted back: "U you can move in UK". Inclima reported that some of the crews of British Airways were corrupt and were willing to smuggle cocaine on flights from Toronto to London for Nero while the Sinaloa Cartel had given Nero permission to sell in Great Britain. Nero also wanted to smuggle cocaine into Shanghai and asked Inclima to find some corrupt aircrews flying to Shanghai who were willing to work for him.  Nero was in contact via texting with someone who called themselves "Brazil lover" to smuggle cocaine into Rio de Janeiro. However, "Brazil lover" warned him that it would difficult to smuggle cocaine into Rio de Janeiro because of the extra security measures due to the 2016 Summer Olympics, which "Brazil lover" stated had also been the case with Vancouver before and during the 2010 Winter Olympics.  Nero was also texting his friend, Mohammed Reza Amin Torabi of Vancouver, a bodybuilder who won the Mr. Canada title twice, about bringing in a shipment of cocaine from Peru via the Port of Vancouver, with 25% of the profits to go to Torabi.

Nero via his texts attacked Inclima for taking his time for having to learn while on the job how to test the purity of the cocaine. Nero planned to sell the more impure cocaine he imported in Toronto, as he stated that most Torontonian drug dealers were lax about testing the cocaine he sold them while he insisted that only the purest cocaine go to Montreal as drug dealers there always tested the quality of the cocaine before buying it. Finally, Nero texted Caputo to ask him to teach how to test the purity of cocaine he was buying. Notably, Nero tended to be submissive in his texts to the Hells Angel Larry Amero and Shane "Wheels" Maloney, the boss of the West End Gang as the Hells Angels control the port of Vancouver while the West End Gang controls the port of Montreal. After Inclima just arrived back from Mexico, Nero immediately ordered him to return to test the cocaine using the knowledge that he acquired from Caputo, leading for Inclima to refuse under the grounds that accusing the Sinaloa Cartel to their faces of fraud was very dangerous, and the authorities would be suspicious if he made too many trips to Mexico over the course of the spring.

Nero had low opinion of Inclima and was recorded by a police bug telling Fletcher: "Al's a fuckin idiot too through. He's just not that cut out for this, he's stupid. He doesn't get anything". Nero told Fletcher that was going to dispose of Inclima and appoint a new agent for dealing with the Sinaloa Cartel. Fletcher objected to his plans not on moral grounds, but rather on the grounds that would be difficult to find someone with the necessary knowledge of Spanish who could be trusted and was willing to go to Mexico to negotiate with the Sinaloa Cartel. Nero ignored her objections and insisted that Inclima had failed him and needed to go, saying: "He can't go there and speak on my behalf. He's fuckin' retard. I'm more confused now than before he got there". Fletcher told Nero he should trying to speak with his Sinola Cartel contact "Carnalito" directly on the phone, advice that he took. Carnalito sent Nero a text in Spanish, which he Fletcher translate for him, but he still failed to understand the text. Much to his vexation, Fletcher kept calling "Piggy" despite his clear dislike of that nickname. By 9 May 2012, Nero was boasting to Alkhalil in his texts he was at the northern end of a vast smuggling nexus running north from Tijuana into Los Angeles and on to Buffalo. Nero also claimed in his texts to have purchased the services of the crew of an Air Canada passenger jet to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into Toronto.

==The Raposo murder==

In the spring of 2012, a love triangle led to a murder. Caputo together with Johnny Raposo, who were supposed best friends, were both having an affair with the same women who worked as a waitress in a Toronto restaurant, whom Edwards and Nájera noted "...was not to be confused with either the mother of Raposo's son or Caputo's moneyed girlfriend". One knew both men very well who did not wish to be identified stated: "He Caputo was pretending to be Johnny's friend. He was a conniver. A real conniver...He was a weasel. Who goes and fucks your girlfriend behind your back?" Caputo became jealous of Raposo, and as he wanted the affections of his mistress all to himself, decided that Raposo had to be killed. Caputo used Nero as his instrument for disposing of his romantic rival Raposo.  Caputo in his texts to Nero expressed much hatred of Raposo as made numerous disparaging remarks about him from April 2012 onward and promoted the thesis that Raposo was an informer. Besides for bragging about love life, Caputo argued to Nero that because Raposo disliked texting via the Pretty Good Privacy network, and instead preferred to use the telephone that proved he must be an informer.

The Italian-Canadian Nero, who very much wanted to join the Mafia, regarded the Mafiosi Caputo as his mentor and tended to follow his lead. Nero always regarded Caputo as the best man to sponsor him to join the Wolfpack elite. Nero constantly needed encouragement and support from Caputo and on 28 April 2012 texted him: "I could really use a hug from u you rite right now". Nero complained to Caputo about having to pay a "work tax" to the Musitano brothers of Hamilton, charging that the Musitanos took it as their right to have a share of his profits because he operated in Niagara peninsula without ever doing anything on his behalf. Nero asked Caputo to speak with the Musitano brothers to reduce their "work tax"; unknown to him, "Fat Pat" Musitano was still angry with Caputo for not financially supporting his wife and children while he was in prison. Nero became convinced that Raposo was an informer and starting on 28 April 2012 started to send texts to Alkhalil demanding that Raposo be murdered.

On 28 April, Nero texted Alkhalil: "We split the load 3 ways. Me u you lil guy Caputo. The only thing is once we pick them up, we have to get him Raposo he is the biggest rat in the world. I told him don't tell anyone I'm doing this for you but the retard can't help his bigmouth".  Nero believed that a hostile audit of him by the Canada Revenue Agency started that spring was due to Raposo informing on him. The possibility that the audit might have been caused by the fact that he lived on welfare while driving about two luxury Italian sports automobiles seemed never to have occurred to Nero. On 15 May 2012, Nero texted Alkhalil: "Remember he Raposo ratted me and lil guy Caputo out. That's why he is getting it". Nero had only met Raposo a few times, but was consumed with hatred for him, obsessively sending Alkhalil texts from April 2012 onward demanding that Raposo be killed. Raposo disliked Nero, as he regarded him as an overbearing man full of braggadocio, telling a friend: "He's thinks I'm stupid". In a text to Caputo, Nero wrote: "We're exterminators. We kill surrichii lol" (surrichii is a Sicilian Italian slang term for informers).

Raposo, Nero, Alkhalil and Caputo were planning to bring in a shipment of cocaine from Mexico via Chicago that was worth $5 million with the profits to be split equally four ways. The last three decided to kill Raposo to take his share of the profits for themselves. To assist with the planned murder, on 18 May 2012 Caputo texted to Nero pictures of Raposo together with his address and that of the Sicilian Sidewalk Café (which was Raposo's favorite coffee shop), saying he should pass this information along to Alkhalil's hitman. At the same time, Caputo had attended the baptism of Raposo's son by his common-law wife Monika and told him numerous times "I love you, bro!". Nero requested that Caputo send pictures of Raposo's son from the baptism to the hitman. On 15 May 2012 Alkhalil texted Nero about who wanted killed, leading the latter to reply that he wanted Raposo and two other men killed. The other two men Nero wanted killed he referred to as "Polish" and "DC". However, Nero's principal concern was having to drive a 2001 Yukon Denali instead of his luxury sports cars as the police wiretaps recorded him frequently cursing his transportation with a typical rant by Nero reading: "Fuck. What's this world coming to? I'm driving a fuckin' 2001 Denali!" The police wiretaps showed that Nero very much wanted to show off his wealth by driving his Ferrari F458 or Maserati GranTurismo automobiles.

On 17 May 2012, Nero sent Alkhalil a text that accused him without evidence of diluting the cocaine he was buying from Montreal. Alkhalil responded the same day by text, where he wrote: "Ur you're guys keep accusing my end of stealing and lying. I don't like it. I would never steal. Not even 100 dollars, and my workers know I'd kill their families for doing the same". Alkhalil hinted that if Nero kept making these accusations he would have him killed. On 21 May 2012, Alkhalil offered his favorite hitman, Dean Michael Wiwchar, $100,000 in cash for killing Raposo. Wiwchar who never met Raposo and did not know nor cared why Alkhalil wanted Raposo dead promptly accepted the offer. Wiwchar texted Alkhalil back on the same afternoon: "Ice cream boy Raposo is getting it. k. ya I'm flying there anyway so ill I'll bang that one off for ya np problem. u you can have the gat gun brought to me in dot Toronto? And the pic? Also can u make sure it is a 45 and or 40 cal gun? And I will get the ride. College Street is heatey i.e. difficult to operate on but if I get em them inside the shop its ok no noise why are we killing ice cream people? LOL!"

On 23 May 2012, Nero was arrested at the St. Catharines half-way house without incident as the supposed "tough guy" Nero offered no resistance. The same day that Nero was arrested, Fletcher was also arrested in Niagara-on-the-Lake and charged with narcotic possession for the purpose of trafficking; conspiracy to import narcotics; conspiracy to traffic in narcotics; conspiracy to possess narcotics for the purpose of trafficking; and counselling to commit obstruction of justice. As Nero's parole conditions had forbidden him to own a cellphone, he left his cellphone at Fletcher's condo. At the time of her arrest, she owned two condos, one in Niagara-on-the-Lake and another condo in Yorkville; two luxury sports automobiles; was wearing a $750,000 engagement ring; and had $1 million in cash in the Yorkville condo. At the time of his arrest, Staff Sergeant Joe Maggiolo of the Niagara Regional Police stated about Nero: "He's the mastermind behind the whole operation"  Much to Nero's intense fury, the police seized his Lamborghini, Ferrari and Maserati as the proceeds of crime and auctioned off all three automobiles to help pay off his $1 million lien. The status-conscious Nero cried uncontrollably for hours when he learned that he had lost forever his three prized Italian sports cars.

Nero could not remember his email address and passport to the Pretty Good Privacy network, so he wrote his email address "Cervezafrya@encryptroid.com" and his password "sharp0" on a yellow sticky note, which was found by the police right next to his cell phone on the kitchen countertop in Fletcher's Niagara-on-the-Lake condo following his arrest on 23 May 2012. Nero also wrote down his password and email address which was found on another sticky pad note placed next to his laptop computer. The columnist Christie Blatchford noted: "Among the things they police saw and photographed was a sticky note with Nero's email and password, which later let them bypass the data encryption program called PGP. The initials stand for Pretty Good Privacy; alas, when the user thoughtfully provides his secret password on a sticky, it's easily defeated." The Sinaloa Cartel had long had doubts about the competence of the Wolfpack, especially Nero, and decided after his arrest to move into Canada themselves.

On 18 June 2012, Wiwchar shot Raposo at the Sicilian Sidewalk Café on Toronto's College Street. Wiwchar walked into the Sicilian Sidewalk Café dressed as a construction worker while wearing a dust mask and a wig. As the ardent football fan Raposo intensely followed the Ireland vs. Italy Euro Cup football match being aired live on the café's television, Wiwchar walked up to him and shot him four times in the head and once in the neck from behind. On the same day, Alkhalil texted Wiwchar: "Time we put u you in sniper school I think. this seems too easy for u". On 20 February 2013, Nero was charged with first-degree murder in connection with Raposo's slaying.

==Convictions==

On September 9, 2014, Nero was convicted of drug trafficking, gangsterism and living off the proceeds of crime.  Justice John McMahon in sentencing him stated "Mr. Nero made a mockery of our parole system" as he noted that Nero was on parole while he was a Wolfpack member who was importing millions of dollars worth of cocaine. On 22 September 2014, Fletcher was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to two years in prison. In April 2015, Fletcher was granted full parole, as the National Parole Board declared: "You are reported to have been a member of the conspiracy for three months and intercepts indicate you had done mathematical calculations for the drugs and finances of the operation, typed emails and cautioned your fiancée on how not to get caught and that he was getting to be too high a profile...You claim you now understand how you became trapped by the lure of an exciting lifestyle with a 'bad boy' who spoiled you with extravagant gifts, exotic vehicles and high-end properties. You admitted to the Board you turned a blind eye and knew you should have left the relationship, but felt trapped". Because of Fletcher's self-confessed weakness for "bad boys", the Parole Board imposed the condition that she provide them with the names of all the men she might have a "sexual or non-sexual relationship with" while on parole.   Mohamed Reza Amin Torabi, the former Mr. Canada bodybuilder and Wolfpack drug smuggler made a plea bargain with the Crown in 2015 where in exchange for a guilty plea he was sentenced to 7 years in prison.

On 5 April 2017, Nero together with Wiwchar, Alkhalil and Caputo went on trial in Toronto for Raposo's murder." At the trial, Nero was defended by Alan Gold, one of Canada's most expensive lawyers. Nero did not testify in his defense. Gold argued that his client was a man too fond of gangster films and together with the other accused were engaged in fantasy role-playing, arguing that the 41, 420 texts sent by the accused over a three month period in 2012 were not plans to murder Raposo, but instead merely role-playing. The defense lawyers argued the man responsible for the Raposo murder was a Wolfpack leader, Frédéric Lavoie of Montreal, who had been dismembered into four pieces while still alive in Columbia in 2014 and thus was conveniently unable to defend his reputation. The Crown Attorney Maurice Gillezeau by contrast argued the texts were evidence of a murder plot, noting that Alkhalil was thrown into a state of panic when Wiwchar was arrested on 21 June 2012, which did not support the fantasy role-playing defense. Edwards and Nájera wrote the Crown's evidence in the form of the 41, 420 texts sent between April–June 2012 was overwhelming and the texting about murders showed the ultimate ineptitude of the Wolfpack, writing: "It's impossible to imagine old-time Mafioso communicating like this. Even outlaw bikers, with their reputation for wildness, avoid such insane sloppiness. Verbalizing something like that is bad enough, but to text it and commit it to the boundless memory of the Internet?"     

On 11 May 2017, Wiwchar, Caputo, Alkhalil and Nero were all found guilty of first-degree murder in Toronto in connection with Raposo's murder in 2012. The accused were all sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole for the next 25 years. As the guilty verdicts were announced, Wiwchar "smirked" in the courtroom as he seemed to take a perverse pride in being found guilty of first-degree murder; Nero looked stunned; Alkhalil showed no emotion; and Caputo kept shaking his head and looking at his family. Justice Robert Clark in sentencing Nero called him an “incorrigible criminal". As Nero was responsible for a murder committed while he was on parole, it is most unlikely that Nero will ever be granted parole again. Nero was attacked in prison by another prisoner who tried to kill him with a home-made knife. The attempt failed, but the one of Nero's eyeballs was ripped out from the socket, leaving him blind in one eye. It is believed that the murder attempt was to punish him for leaving his email address and passport to the Pretty Good Privacy network out in plain view in Fletcher's condo.

Early street lights in New Zealand were first installed in major cities in the 1860s with Christchurch recording having 152 gas lamps throughout the city. With the shift to electric lights cities moved away from gas lamps and on to the incandescent lamps with the towns of Wellington (1889) and Reefton (early 1900s) becoming the first cities in the southern hemisphere to have electric street lights. Other towns soon followed suit with the town of Brightwater adding five and Richmond adding ten street lights in 1911. During the mid 20th century a move towards fluorescent lamps was taken up. Pressing into the 21st century New Zealand likemuch of the industrialized world has been expanding the installation of LED lights, and have seen large savings. In modern times communities in New Zealand have turned their street lights off for multiple reasons including to save energy and to help protect local wildlife in particular the Westland petrel as well as reduce light pollution.

[[Height above mean sea level]]

CATEGORIES: Geography terminology, Geodesy, Topography, Altitudes in aviation, Vertical position, Zero-level elevation points

Height above mean sea level is a measure of the vertical distance (height, elevation or altitude) of a location in reference to a historic mean sea level taken as a vertical datum. In geodesy, it is formalized as orthometric heights.

The quantity is called "metres above mean sea level" in the metric system, while in United States customary and imperial units it would be called "feet above mean sea level".

Mean sea levels are affected by climate change and other factors and change over time. For this and other reasons, recorded measurements of elevation above sea level at a reference time in history might differ from the actual elevation of a given location over sea level at a given moment.

==Uses==

Metres above sea level is internationally the standard measurement of the elevation or altitude of:

==Methods of measurement==

The elevation or altitude in metres above sea level of a location, object, or point can be determined in a number of ways. The most common include:

Accurate measurement of historical mean sea levels is complex. Land mass subsidence (as occurs naturally in some regions) can give the appearance of rising sea levels. Conversely, markings on land masses that are uplifted due to geological processes can suggest a lowering of mean sea level.

==Abbreviations==

Often, just the abbreviation MSL is used, e.g. Mount Everest (8848 m MSL), or the reference height is omitted completely, e.g. Mount Everest (8848 m).May 2023

Metres above mean sea level is commonly abbreviated mamsl or MAMSL, based on the abbreviation AMSL for "above mean sea level".October 2021

Other abbreviations are m.a.s.l. and MASL for "metres above sea level".

[[Don Aitken Centre]]

CATEGORIES: East Perth, Western Australia, International Style (architecture), Brutalist architecture in Australia, State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Perth

The Don Aitken Centre, also known as the Main Roads Western Australia Building, is a 10-storey office building in East Perth, Western Australia. It has been the main office of Main Roads Western Australia since it opened in 1970.

==History==

Western Australia's economy boomed in the decades following World War II as the state rapidly increased its gold and iron ore production. This resulted in the development of freeways and other roads in Perth, expanding the responsibility of the Main Roads Department. Many colonial and gold rush era buildings in Perth were being demolished as well, to be replaced with modernist buildings.7 This included the Colonial Barracks, were the Main Roads Department was based. In 1967, it was decided that the Main Roads Department would need its own building. A site was chosen in East Perth at the end of Wellington Street. On the site was a brick house, shed, and changing rooms which were demolished, and a sports playing field which was levelled.8

In early 1968, tenders were called for. A contract worth $3,266,330 was awarded, however after a fifth of the work was completed, the contractor went bankrupt, pausing construction until a new contract was signed. The design of the building was done by local architecture firm Oldham, Boas, Ednie-Brown & Partners.8 H. A. Doust Pty Ltd took over construction of the building, and it was completed in 1970, with Main Roads staff moving into the building in June of that year. This was the first time since 1928 that all Main Roads staff were in one building. Main Roads only had 430 staff, below the building's maximum occupancy of 660 people, so the remaining space was occupied by police administration.11 The building was officially opened by the premier of Western Australia, Sir David Brand, on 27 November 1970.12

The building was named the Don Aitken Centre on 25 May 1993. Aitken had worked for Main Roads for 41 years, including 22 years as Commissioner of Main Roads. He retired in 1987.12

On 25 May 2022, the Don Aitken Centre was placed on the State Register of Heritage Places.

==Description==

The Don Aitken Centre is an office building consisting of 10-storeys plus a basement. It was designed in the Late Twentieth Century International Style with elements of Brutalist architecture.6, 10 A bronze sculpture by Margaret Priest is located within the foyer. It was officially unveiled by the minister for works, Ross Hutchinson, on 28 October 1970, and forms the basis of Main Roads' logo.6, 11

The initial design had eight floors dedicated to office space, one floor with a cafeteria and recreation facilities, one floor for the caretaker's quarters, mechanical rooms and an observation gallery, and a car park in the basement.8–9

The building was positioned such that another office building could be constructed on the same site to the north.8

Malabo Mosque (Mezquita de Malabo; Mosquée de Malabo; Mesquita Malabo) also known as Malabo Central Mosque (Mezquita Central de Malabo) is a mosque in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. It is the largest mosque in Equatorial Guinea and can accommodate two thousand people.

==History==

Hausa Muslims from Cameroon and Nigeria built a mosque in Malabo sometime in the early 20th century. They sold African masks and statues to European settlers and supplied plantation managers with imported goods such as medicine brought in from Nigeria. The mosque they built no longer exists, having been demolished due to its dilapidated state. It was replaced by a temporary mosque in the northern suburbs of Malabo. 

In 2014, the First Lady of Equatorial Guinea, Constancia Mangue, agreed to finance the construction of a new mosque in the city. The approximate cost of the mosque was two billion Central African CFA francs or about three million euros.

On 21 July 2015, Malabo Mosque was officially opened by the President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, his wife and the two vice presidents Ignacio Milam Tang and Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue. The inauguration of the mosque was also attended by the Prime Minister of Egypt Ibrahim Mahlab, President of the Comoros Ikililou Dhoinine and Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic politician Mohamed Lamine Ould Ahmed who was both the Minister of Health and Special Envoy to the African Summit on Ebola. Mahlab and the Ministry of Awqaf provided imams and preachers to the mosque as part of Egypt's role spreading the teachings of Islam. The imam and spiritual leader of the Muslim community of Equatorial Guinea, Pedro Benigno Matute Tang began the ceremony with words of thanks. In his inauguration ceremony speech, President Obiang said that the mosque will be an "Islamic beacon of coexistence" for "social and religious tolerance". He also said that Islam cannot be viewed as a "religion of terror, discrimination or extremism".

In 2020, two Equatoguinean Muslims were given Samsung-branded products in an award ceremony at the mosque as part of a contest to encourage young people to read and study.

CATEGORIES: 1947 births, Living people, American operatic sopranos, Boston Conservatory at Berklee faculty, Juilliard School alumni, University of Northern Iowa alumni, People from Monticello, Iowa

Sheri Greenawald (born November 12, 1947) is an American soprano and music educator who had an active performance career in concerts and operas during the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century. She has portrayed principal roles in the world premieres of several operas, including works by composers Leonard Bernstein, Daniel Catán, Carlisle Floyd, Thomas Pasatieri, and Stephen Paulus.

Music critic Michael Walsh wrote that, " Only partly in jest, Greenawald has been described as a ‘heroic soubrette’. Her lyric soprano voice is aptly suited to such Mozartian roles as Susanna, Zerlina, and Despina, Norina (Don Pasquale) and Sophie (Werther), but it also has considerable power and range, suitable for the heavier parts of Ellen Orford, Mimì and Violetta."

==Early life and education==

Born Sheri Kay Greenawald in Iowa City, Iowa on November 12, 1947, Greenawald grew up in Monticello, Iowa.

[[Autograph show]]

CATEGORIES: Collecting

An autograph show (or, alternatively, autograph meeting, autograph signing or autograph convention) is an event where the public, mostly autograph collectors or fans of an attending celebrity, gather to collect autographs from someone famous who attends to meet fans and sign items for them. Some autograph shows are part of a larger, comicon event, while others can be part of a specific event, such as the Super Bowl weeks' activities.

Celebrities from all walks of life attend shows, but usually these shows bring celebrity athletes, singers and movie stars and book authors to meet their fans. 

These meetings are usually held at places such as convention centers, hotels, stadiums and stores. However, other venues, such as churches or sports gyms have also been used.

==Economics==

These shows can bring a new source of income to celebrities, as many of them charge for the signatures they give. Some entertainers charge organizers about $5,000 to $10,000 as fees for appearing. Such fees are then offset by the organizers by charging fans for the right to receive the celebrity or celebrities' autographs. Yet some other shows are completely free of charge. The latter are usually organized by a local sports team or entertainment venue that wants local fans to get acquainted with a celebrity who will play for the local team or who will appear at something the entertainment venue is about to offer. 

In addition, book authors often do autograph shows to promote their newly released books.

==Conventions==

There are many international autograph conventions, some of which last multiple days. These are popular in places such as the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

==Difference between autograph shows and some meet and greets==

A major difference between autograph shows and meet and greet shows is that some meet and greet shows do not allow fans to ask celebrities for autographs.

[[Social Security Forces]]

CATEGORIES: Law enforcement in North Korea, Government agencies of North Korea, Military of North Korea

Social Security Forces (조선사회안전군) is a North Korean paramilitary force which performs various internal security and border security tasks. It has 11,000 to 140,000 troops.

==Organization==

In peacetime, it is under the command of the Ministry of Social Security, the principal law-enforcement agency, but in case of emergency, it is more heavily armed than the border guards of other countries because it is incorporated into the regular army. The commander of the Social Security Forces is concurrently the First deputy minister of Social Security, at some point of time Ri Thae-chol 리태철

==History==

The roots of the Social Security Forces began in 1947 with the creation of the 5th Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs which succeeded the 38th Guard Corps. With the separation of the Ministry of Social Security in October 1962, the People's Guard was created and placed under it. In the 1980s, the work of the Korean People's Guard was transferred to the Ministry of National Security, and it is understood that in October 1996, the border guard service was transferred to the Ministry of People's Armed Forces, the predecessor of the Ministry of National Defence. In 2010 the People's Guards Forces (Korean: 조선인민경비대) was changed to Korean People's Internal Security Forces (Korean: 조선인민내무군) and was subordinated to the Ministry of People's Security. On the June 28th, 2020, the Rodong Sinmun published the name 'Social Security Forces' in an article titled 'The Immediate Goal of Socialist Construction', saying, "The Social Security Force must successfully carry out the noble missions and duties of the Suyeong security, institutional security, and people's security."

==Tasks==

The Korean People's Guard is known to be in charge of guarding the Military Demarcation Line, borders, and coasts, as well as major strategic facilities such as government offices, the Central Committee Yongbyon nuclear facilities, power plants and broadcasting facilities.

Kulosaari Church (Finnish: Kulosaaren kirkko, Swedish: Brändö kyrka) is a Lutheran church located in the Kulosaari suburb of Helsinki, Finland.

==History==

The Kulosaari parish was established in 1921, and the planning for a church began immediately; however, it took more than a decade before the current church building was completed in 1935.

The church is located on top of the tallest hill in Kulosaari, and became soon after its completion known locally as "the Temple on the Hill".

==Architecture==

The main church building was designed in Jugendstil style by Bertel Jung, who was also responsible for the overall urban plan of Kulosaari.

The separate belfry, completed four years before the church itself, and standing circa 30 from the church building, was initially designed by Armas Lindgren, and completed after his death by his daughter, architect Helena Stenij.

The church and its surrounding milieu have been designated and protected by the Finnish Heritage Agency as a nationally important built cultural environment (Valtakunnallisesti merkittävä rakennettu kulttuuriympäristö).

===Interior design===

The ceiling and the stained-glass window were designed by Armas Lindgren's son-in-law, artist Antti Salmenlinna.

Bertel Jung's daughter, interior architect Gunilla Jung, designed various interior features including the silver baptismal font, while his niece, textile artist Dora Jung, designed the priest's chasuble in white silk velvet.

[[Hydrogen compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrogen, Chemical compounds by element, Hydrogen compounds

Hydrogen compounds are compounds containg the element hydrogen. In these compounds, hydrogen can form in the +1 and -1 oxidation states. Hydrogen can form compounds both ionically and in covalent substances. It is a part of many organic compounds such as hydrocarbons as well as water and other organic substances. The H+ ion is often called a proton because it has one proton and no electrons, although the proton does not move freely. Brønsted–Lowry acids are capable of donating H+ ions to bases.

==Covalent and organic compounds==

While H2 is not very reactive under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to a more electronegative element, particularly fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with another electronegative element with a lone pair, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that is critical to the stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and metalloids, where it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.

Water contains two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen atom, and is one of the most well-studied compounds.

Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.

===Hydrocarbons===

Hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons, and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that, because of their general association with living things, are called organic compounds. The study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry. By some definitions, "organic" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond that gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word "organic" in chemistry. Millions of hydrocarbons are known, and they are usually formed by complicated pathways that seldom involve elemental hydrogen.

==Hydrides==

Compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term "hydride" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H−, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at the anode. For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is BeH2, which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the AlH4- anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).

Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known, but only one binary aluminium hydride. Binary indium hydride has not yet been identified, although larger complexes exist.

In inorganic chemistry, hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex. This function is particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron hydrides) and aluminium complexes, as well as in clustered carboranes.

==Protons and acids==

Oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives H+, which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton. That is why H+ is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of acids. Under the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.

A bare proton, H+, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the electron clouds of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted "H+" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.

To avoid the implication of the naked "solvated proton" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the "hydronium ion" (H3O+). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to H9O4+. Other oxonium ions are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents.

Although exotic on Earth, one of the most common ions in the universe is the H3+ ion, known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation.

Shawne Jackson is a singer, songwriter from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She had a Canadian Top 10 hit in 1974 with "Just As Bad As You". During her career she has provided the voice for Teacher Harriet in Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, contributed backing vocals on "I'm A W.O.M.A.N." for Lydia Taylor, backing vocals on For Those Who Think Young by Rough Trade,  backing vocals on the Alice Cooper Goes to Hell album by Alice Cooper, backing  vocals on Fret Fever by Domenic Troiano. She was also nominee for the 1976 Juno Award for Breakthrough Artist of the Year.

==Background==

She is the great granddaughter of Albert Jackson, Canada's first Black letter carrier. 

During the late 1960s, Shawne and her brother Jay Jackson were the lead singers in a popular Canadian r&b group The Majestics.

She was married to Domenic Troiano who produced her hit "Just As Bad As You".  He died in 2005 from Cancer.

==Career==

In 1974, she was backed by a band called West which included Paul Sanderson who would later become a leading entertainment lawyer in Canada. The group auditioned for the management company, Magic Management who took them along with the group Truck. It was via Magic Management that they ended up auditioning for Jackson who at that time was Domenic Troiano's girlfriend. West backed her for three months and then she had her hit "Just As Bad As You". By that time she had formed her own backing band. West broke up that year.

In May, 1974, "Just As Bad As You" was released. The A side was composed by Domenic Troiano. The B side, "He May Be Your Man" she co-wrote with Troiano. Both sides were produced by Troiano and  Keith Olsen. On May 28 a successful reception  was held for her at The Generator in Toronto with the help from Quality Records. The single got to #10 in Canada in June. It also got to #98 on the US R&B chart. The Cash Box international bestsellers, Canada chart recorded it at #6 just ahead of the "Time To Cry" single by Don Goodwin in the June 15 issue. 

Also in June, with her single doing well in Canada, she was touring with the group Sweet Blindness.

The August 9, 1975, issue of Billboard mentioned that Jackson was working on a follow-up to "Just As Bad As You". It also mentioned the side activities of Dominic Troiano who was then part of the new Guess Who line up. He had recently finished producing a session for Jackson.

Simon Hall (1977 or 1978 – 23 February 2014) was a British murderer who was the subject of a lengthy campaign by miscarriage of justice activists to overturn his conviction, only for him to go on to confess to the murder he was convicted of. Hall stabbed 79-year-old pensioner Joan Albert to death in her home in Capel St Mary, Suffolk in 2001, and was convicted of her murder two years later. Subsequently, the high-profile miscarriage of justice programme Rough Justice took up his case and aired a programme campaigning for him. Several MPs, Bristol University's 'Innocence Project' campaign group, his mother and his girlfriend Stephanie Hall were also involved in campaigning for him, and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (which had itself been set up in response to Rough Justice in 1997) referred his case to the Court of Appeal in 2009. However, the appeal court dismissed the appeal and he subsequently confessed his crime to prison authorities in 2013, before committing suicide in prison in 2014. His case was said to have gravely undermined the claims of many prisoners who claim their innocence and embarrassed miscarriage of justice activists, having proved that they had campaigned for a guilty man. 

The family of victim Joan Albert released a statement following Hall's confession saying: "During the last 10 years the publicity surrounding the appeals has been very distressing for our family, making moving on impossible...  we are also grateful to those who have helped us throughout this difficult ordeal".

==Murder==

Hall was a burglar and had previous convictions for violence. He murdered Joan Albert, 79, in her home in Capel St Mary, Suffolk on 16 December 2001 in a burglary attempt gone wrong, stabbing her five times with a carving knife from her kitchen and leaving her to be found in her hallway. Hall had been out drinking with friends in Ipswich the night before the murder and had an alibi for most of the night and into the early hours of the following morning, except for between 5:30am and 6:15am, which was believed to be the time when the murder was committed. He was convicted of her murder in 2003 and sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years imprisonment, with the jury finding him guilty by a unanimous decision.

==Claims of innocence and assistance==

Hall refused to acknowledge his guilt and his legal team attempted to discredit the fibre evidence against him. In 2007 his case was promoted by Rough Justice. His case was also taken up by the University of Bristol Innocence Project (UoBIP), and they helped his case get referred to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 2009 via the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Hall's wife Stephanie, who he had married in prison in 2005, was convinced of his claims of innocence, saying: "There was never a shadow of a doubt that they had the wrong guy, he didn't have it in him – he's too sensitive and kind." For many years she ran a campaign called "Justice 4 Simon" in an attempt to free him from prison, and Hall regularly sent online messages to his supporters. Friends and family of Hall also backed him, setting up a website to highlight what they believed were the weaknesses in the prosecution case against him, and wrongly claiming that he had no motive for killing Albert, a friend of his mother's. His campaign also won the backing of a number of MPs, and his case also featured in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth about British Justice by Sandra Lean. Famous lawyer Michael Mansfield agreed to represent him legally and lead his campaign to be freed.

==Appeal==

In 2011 the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction, concluding that the conviction was correct and saying: "The scientific support for the assertion that the appellant was the source of the fibres found at the crime scene is compelling. We have no reason to doubt the safety of the jury's verdict and the appeal is dismissed." Even after this appeal was rejected the Bristol Innocence Project continued to promote his claims of innocence, complaining that the Court of Appeal had not taken his claims of innocence "seriously" and saying that they didn't seek "the truth of whether alleged victims of wrongful convictions are innocent or not". However, by this time Hall had already confessed to the crime to his wife Stephanie, revealing details including his motive for the crime. Despite this, Stephanie Hall continued to protest his innocence to national prisoners' newspaper Inside Time.

==Confession==

In 2013, following the rejection of his appeal, Hall formally admitted his guilt to prison authorities after ten years of claiming his innocence, leading to outrage in the national media.  The Telegraph reported that his trial and appeal had cost the taxpayer between £400,000 and £500,000. Thousands of hours of legal research had been wasted on attempting to clear Hall's name, including many hours of work conducted by unpaid volunteers of the University of Bristol Innocence Project. In January earlier in the year the CCRC had also been examining a new claim by Hall that he was carrying out a burglary elsewhere on the day Albert's body was found, but Hall dropped this appeal after he finally admitted his guilt. Campaigner Ray Hollingsworth, who had claimed that he had gathered evidence that showed two other people were responsible for the murder, said: "If I'm wrong about this, I'm wrong. I will hold my hands up. I'm not going to hide from anyone. I believed in his innocence".

Retired detective Roy Lambert, who led the original inquiry, said in response to the confession: "I've always been satisfied that he was responsible for killing Joan. Lots and lots of people were supporting him, MPs were supporting him and now he's deceived all of them because all along he's known that he's done it". Suffolk Police released a statement saying: "Over the 10 years since Hall's conviction there have been a number of appeals and campaigns which have asserted that Simon Hall was wrongfully convicted of Mrs Albert's murder. These events and the related uncertainty have undoubtedly exacerbated the suffering Mrs Albert's family have had to endure since Joan was murdered. We sincerely hope that Simon Hall's admissions to having committed this brutal crime will in some way enable the family to move on with their lives." The family of victim Joan Albert, who had had to endure years of claims that Hall was innocent, released a statement saying: "During the last 10 years the publicity surrounding the appeals has been very distressing for our family, making moving on impossible, but we would like to thank Suffolk Police, including Roy Lambert and his team, who carried out the original investigation, to present day officers who continue to support us. We are also grateful to those who have helped us throughout this difficult ordeal".

==Suicide==

Only one year after he finally confessed, Hall was found unresponsive in his cell at HM Prison Wayland in Norfolk, and was later pronounced dead, having committed suicide by hanging.  Stephanie Hall accepted that she had wrongly believed in his innocence.

==Impact==

The Hall case was described as an embarrassment to miscarriage of justice activists and an example of a case that they "quietly bury" as they do not wish to appear to have wrongly defended a guilty person. The New Statesman said that the Hall case had "gravely undermined the claims of many of the genuinely innocent".

[[Titanium compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Titanium, Titanium compounds, Chemical compounds by element

The +4 oxidation state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 oxidation state are also numerous. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because of its high oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit a high degree of covalent bonding.

==Oxides, sulfides, and alkoxides==

The most important oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. All three are white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see rutile). They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.

The term titanates usually refers to titanium(IV) compounds, as represented by barium titanate (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Many minerals are titanates, such as ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.

A variety of reduced oxides (suboxides) of titanium are known, mainly reduced stoichiometries of titanium dioxide obtained by atmospheric plasma spraying. Ti3O5, described as a Ti(IV)-Ti(III) species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO2 with hydrogen at high temperatures, and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapor-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas TiO2 evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index. Also known is Ti2O3, with the corundum structure, and TiO, with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.

The alkoxides of titanium(IV), prepared by treating TiCl4 with alcohols, are colorless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water. They are industrially useful for depositing solid TiO2 via the sol-gel process. Titanium isopropoxide is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the Sharpless epoxidation.

Titanium forms a variety of sulfides, but only TiS2 has attracted significant interest. It adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in the development of lithium batteries. Because Ti(IV) is a "hard cation", the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend to hydrolyze to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide.

==Nitrides and carbides==

Titanium nitride (TiN) is a refractory solid exhibiting extreme hardness, thermal/electrical conductivity, and a high melting point. TiN has a hardness equivalent to sapphire and carborundum (9.0 on the Mohs scale), and is often used to coat cutting tools, such as drill bits. It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a barrier layer in semiconductor fabrication. Titanium carbide (TiC), which is also very hard, is found in cutting tools and coatings.

==Halides==

Titanium tetrachloride (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial samples are yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 is used in the conversion of titanium ores to titanium metal. Titanium tetrachloride is also used to make titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. In the van Arkel–de Boer process, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated in the production of high purity titanium metal.

Titanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable chlorides. A notable example is titanium(III) chloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst for production of polyolefins (see Ziegler–Natta catalyst) and a reducing agent in organic chemistry.

==Organometallic complexes==

Owing to the important role of titanium compounds as polymerization catalyst, compounds with Ti-C bonds have been intensively studied. The most common organotitanium complex is titanocene dichloride ((C5H5)2TiCl2). Related compounds include Tebbe's reagent and Petasis reagent. Titanium forms carbonyl complexes, e.g. (C5H5)2Ti(CO)2.

==Anticancer therapy studies==

Following the success of platinum-based chemotherapy, titanium(IV) complexes were among the first non-platinum compounds to be tested for cancer treatment. The advantage of titanium compounds lies in their high efficacy and low toxicity in vivo. In biological environments, hydrolysis leads to the safe and inert titanium dioxide. Despite these advantages the first candidate compounds failed clinical trials due to insufficient efficacy to toxicity ratios and formulation complications. Further development resulted in the creation of potentially effective, selective, and stable titanium-based drugs.

[[Cobalt compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Cobalt compounds, Chemical compounds by element

Cobalt compounds are chemical compounds formed by cobalt with other elements. 

==Inorganic compounds==

===Halides===

Many halides of cobalt(II) are known.e cobalt(II) fluoride (CoF2) which is a pink solid, cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2) which is a blue solid, cobalt(II) bromide (CoBr2) which is a green solid, and cobalt(II) iodide (CoI2) which is a blue-black solid. In addition to the anhydrous forms, these cobalt halides also have hydrates. Anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride is blue, while the hexahydrate is red-purple. Because the color change of cobalt(II) chloride in different hydrates, it can be used to manufacture color-changing silica gel.

Anhydrous cobalt halides react with nitric oxide at 70~120 °C to generate Co(NO)2X2 (X = Cl, Br or I). The complex of cobalt halides and triethylphosphine ((C2H5)3P) can absorb nitric monoxide in benzene to form the diamagnetic material Co(NO)X2(P(C2H5)3)

In the reaction Co + e− → Co, the potential is +1.92 V, which is higher than that of Cl2 to Cl− (+1.36 V). Therefore, the interaction of Co3+ with Cl− produces Co2+ and releases chlorine gas. The potential from F2 to F− is as high as +2.87 V, and cobalt(III) fluoride (CoF3) can exist stably. It is a fluorinated reagent and reacts violently with water.

===Oxides and hydroxides===

Cobalt can form various oxides, such as CoO, Co2O3 and Co3O4. Co3O4, at 950 °C, decomposes to CoO.

Soluble cobalt salts react with sodium hydroxide to obtain cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)2):

Cobalt(II) hydroxide can be oxidized to the Co(III) compound CoO(OH) under alkaline conditions.

===Pnictogenides===

Cobalt powder reacts with ammonia to form two kinds of nitrides, Co2N and Co3N. Cobalt reacts with phosphorus or arsenic to form Co2P, CoP, CoP2, CoAs2 and other substances.  The former three compounds are of interest as catalysts for water electrolysis.  

Cobalt(II) azide (Co(N3)2) is another binary compound of cobalt and nitrogen that can explode when heated. Cobalt(II) and azide can form Co(N complexes. Cobalt pentazolide Co(N5)2 was discovered in 2017, and it exists in the form of the hydrate Co(H2O)4(N5)2·4H2O. It decomposes at 50~145 °C to form cobalt(II) azide, becoming anhydrous and releasing nitrogen, and exploding when heated further. This compound can be obtained by reacting (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl or Na(H2O)(N5)]·2H2O and Co(H2O)6(NO3)2 at room temperature. Hydrogen bonding of water stabilizes this molecule.

Cobalt can easily react with nitric acid to form cobalt(II) nitrate Co(NO3)2. Cobalt(II) nitrate exists in the anhydrous form and the hydrate form, of which the hexahydrate is the most common. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) is a red deliquescence crystal that is easily soluble in water, and its molecule contains cobalt(II) hydrated ions (Co(H2O)62+) and free nitrate ions. It can be obtained by precipitation from solution.

==Coordination compounds==

As for all metals, molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are classified as coordination complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to one or more ligands. These can be combinations of a potentially infinite variety of molecules and ions, such as:

These attached groups affect the stability of oxidation states of the cobalt atoms, according to general principles of  electronegativity and of the hardness–softness. For example, Co3+ complexes tend to have ammine ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride (P). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+ derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate(IV) (Cs2CoF6) and potassium percobaltate (K3CoO4).

Alfred Werner, a Nobel-prize winning pioneer in coordination chemistry, worked with compounds of empirical formula Co. One of the isomers determined was cobalt(III) hexammine chloride. This coordination complex, a typical Werner-type complex, consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by six ammine orthogonal ligands and three chloride counteranions. Using chelating ethylenediamine ligands in place of ammonia gives tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) (Co(en)), which was one of the first coordination complexes to be resolved into optical isomers. The complex exists in the right- and left-handed forms of a "three-bladed propeller". This complex was first isolated by Werner as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.

==Organic compounds==

Vitamin B12 is a cobalt-centered organic biomolecule, soluble in water, and involved in the methylation and synthesis of nucleic acid and neurotransmitter. The main source is the offal or meat of herbivorous animals.

Dicobalt octacarbonyl (Co2(CO)8) is an orange-red crystal with two isomers in solution:

It reacts with hydrogen or sodium to form HCo(CO)4 or NaCo(CO)4. It is a catalyst in carbonylation and hydrosilylation reactions.

Cobaltocene (Co(C5H5)2) is a cyclopentadiene complex of cobalt. It has 19 valence electrons and is easily oxidized to Co(C with a stable structure of 18 electrons by reaction. It is a structural analog to ferrocene, with cobalt in place of iron. Cobaltocene is much more sensitive to oxidation than ferrocene.

[[Copper compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Copper compounds, Copper, Chemical compounds by element

Copper forms a rich variety of compounds, usually with oxidation states +1 and +2, which are often called cuprous and cupric, respectively. Copper compounds, whether organic complexes or organometallics, promote or catalyse numerous chemical and biological processes.

==Binary compounds==

As with other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and halides. Both cuprous and cupric oxides are known. Among the numerous copper sulfides, important examples include copper(I) sulfide and copper(II) sulfide.January 2021

Cuprous halides with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine are known, as are cupric halides with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts to prepare copper(II) iodide yield only copper(I) iodide and iodine.

==Coordination chemistry==

Copper forms coordination complexes with ligands. In aqueous solution, copper(II) exists as Cu. This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate (speed of water ligands attaching and detaching) for any transition metal aquo complex. Adding aqueous sodium hydroxide causes the precipitation of light blue solid copper(II) hydroxide. A simplified equation is: 

Aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate. Upon adding excess ammonia, the precipitate dissolves, forming tetraamminecopper(II):

Many other oxyanions form complexes; these include copper(II) acetate, copper(II) nitrate, and copper(II) carbonate. Copper(II) sulfate forms a blue crystalline pentahydrate, the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory. It is used in a fungicide called the Bordeaux mixture.

Polyols, compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids such as cystine form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.January 2021

==Organocopper chemistry==

Compounds that contain a carbon-copper bond are known as organocopper compounds. They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper(I) oxide and have many uses in chemistry. They are synthesized by treating copper(I) compounds with Grignard reagents, terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents; in particular, the last reaction described produces a Gilman reagent. These can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products; as such, they are important in the field of organic synthesis. Copper(I) acetylide is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling and the Sonogashira coupling. Conjugate addition to enones and carbocupration of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds. Copper(I) forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide, especially in the presence of amine ligands.

==Copper(III) and copper(IV)==

Copper(III) is most often found in oxides. A simple example is potassium cuprate, KCuO2, a blue-black solid. The most extensively studied copper(III) compounds are the cuprate superconductors. Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres. Like oxide, fluoride is a highly basic anion and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states. Both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known, K3CuF6 and Cs2CuF6, respectively.

Some copper proteins form oxo complexes, which also feature copper(III). With tetrapeptides, purple-colored copper(III) complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated amide ligands.

Complexes of copper(III) are also found as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds. For example, in the Kharasch–Sosnovsky reaction.January 2021

[[Gallium compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Gallium compounds, Chemical compounds by element

Gallium compounds are compounds containing the element gallium. These compounds are found primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The +1 oxidation state is also found in some compounds, although it is less common than it is for gallium's heavier congeners indium and thallium. For example, the very stable GaCl2 contains both gallium(I) and gallium(III) and can be formulated as GaIGaIIICl4; in contrast, the monochloride is unstable above 0 °C, disproportionating into elemental gallium and gallium(III) chloride. Compounds containing Ga–Ga bonds are true gallium(II) compounds, such as GaS (which can be formulated as Ga24+(S2−)2) and the dioxan complex Ga2Cl4(C4H8O2)2. There are also compounds of gallium with negative oxidation states, ranging from -5 to -1, most of these compounds being magnesium gallides (MgxGay).

==Aqueous chemistry==

Strong acids dissolve gallium, forming gallium(III) salts such as Ga(NO (gallium nitrate). Aqueous solutions of gallium(III) salts contain the hydrated gallium ion, Ga(H.1033 Gallium(III) hydroxide, Ga(OH), may be precipitated from gallium(III) solutions by adding ammonia. Dehydrating Ga(OH) at 100 °C produces gallium oxide hydroxide, GaO(OH).140–141

Alkaline hydroxide solutions dissolve gallium, forming gallate salts (not to be confused with identically named gallic acid salts) containing the Ga(OH) anion.1033 Gallium hydroxide, which is amphoteric, also dissolves in alkali to form gallate salts.141 Although earlier work suggested Ga(OH) as another possible gallate anion, it was not found in later work.

==Oxides and chalcogenides==

Gallium reacts with the chalcogens only at relatively high temperatures. At room temperature, gallium metal is not reactive with air and water because it forms a passive, protective oxide layer. At higher temperatures, however, it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form gallium(III) oxide, Ga. Reducing Ga with elemental gallium in vacuum at 500 °C to 700 °C yields the dark brown gallium(I) oxide, Ga.285 Ga is a very strong reducing agent, capable of reducing H to H.207 It disproportionates at 800 °C back to gallium and Ga.

Gallium(III) sulfide, Ga, has 3 possible crystal modifications.104 It can be made by the reaction of gallium with hydrogen sulfide (H) at 950 °C.162 Alternatively, Ga(OH) can be used at 747 °C:

Reacting a mixture of alkali metal carbonates and Ga with H leads to the formation of thiogallates containing the Ga anion. Strong acids decompose these salts, releasing H in the process.104–105 The mercury salt, HgGa, can be used as a phosphor.

Gallium also forms sulfides in lower oxidation states, such as gallium(II) sulfide and the green gallium(I) sulfide, the latter of which is produced from the former by heating to 1000 °C under a stream of nitrogen.94

The other binary chalcogenides, Ga and Ga, have the zincblende structure. They are all semiconductors but are easily hydrolysed and have limited utility.104

==Nitrides and pnictides==

Gallium reacts with ammonia at 1050 °C to form gallium nitride, GaN. Gallium also forms binary compounds with phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony: gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium antimonide (GaSb). These compounds have the same structure as ZnS, and have important semiconducting properties.1034 GaP, GaAs, and GaSb can be synthesized by the direct reaction of gallium with elemental phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony.99 They exhibit higher electrical conductivity than GaN.101 GaP can also be synthesized by reacting Ga with phosphorus at low temperatures.

Gallium forms ternary nitrides; for example:99

Similar compounds with phosphorus and arsenic are possible: Li and Li. These compounds are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acids and water.101

==Halides==

Gallium(III) oxide reacts with fluorinating agents such as HF or F to form gallium(III) fluoride, GaF. It is an ionic compound strongly insoluble in water. However, it dissolves in hydrofluoric acid, in which it forms an adduct with water, GaF. Attempting to dehydrate this adduct forms GaF. The adduct reacts with ammonia to form GaF, which can then be heated to form anhydrous GaF.128–129

Gallium trichloride is formed by the reaction of gallium metal with chlorine gas. Unlike the trifluoride, gallium(III) chloride exists as dimeric molecules, Ga, with a melting point of 78 °C. Eqivalent compounds are formed with bromine and iodine, Ga and Ga.133

Like the other group 13 trihalides, gallium(III) halides are Lewis acids, reacting as halide acceptors with alkali metal halides to form salts containing GaX anions, where X is a halogen. They also react with alkyl halides to form carbocations and GaX.136–137

When heated to a high temperature, gallium(III) halides react with elemental gallium to form the respective gallium(I) halides. For example, GaCl reacts with Ga to form GaCl:

At lower temperatures, the equilibrium shifts toward the left and GaCl disproportionates back to elemental gallium and GaCl. GaCl can also be produced by reacting Ga with HCl at 950 °C; the product can be condensed as a red solid.1036

Gallium(I) compounds can be stabilized by forming adducts with Lewis acids. For example:

The so-called "gallium(II) halides", GaX, are actually adducts of gallium(I) halides with the respective gallium(III) halides, having the structure Ga. For example:1036

==Hydrides==

Like aluminium, gallium also forms a hydride, GaH, known as gallane, which may be produced by reacting lithium gallanate (LiGaH) with gallium(III) chloride at −30 °C:1031

In the presence of dimethyl ether as solvent, GaH polymerizes to (GaH. If no solvent is used, the dimer Ga (digallane) is formed as a gas. Its structure is similar to diborane, having two hydrogen atoms bridging the two gallium centers,1031 unlike α-AlH in which aluminium has a coordination number of 6.1008

Gallane is unstable above −10 °C, decomposing to elemental gallium and hydrogen.

==Organogallium compounds==

Organogallium compounds are of similar reactivity to organoindium compounds, less reactive than organoaluminium compounds, but more reactive than organothallium compounds. Alkylgalliums are monomeric. Lewis acidity decreases in the order Al > Ga > In and as a result organogallium compounds do not form bridged dimers as organoaluminium compounds do. Organogallium compounds are also less reactive than organoaluminium compounds. They do form stable peroxides. These alkylgalliums are liquids at room temperature, having low melting points, and are quite mobile and flammable. Triphenylgallium is monomeric in solution, but its crystals form chain structures due to weak intermolecluar Ga···C interactions.

Gallium trichloride is a common starting reagent for the formation of organogallium compounds, such as in carbogallation reactions. Gallium trichloride reacts with lithium cyclopentadienide in diethyl ether to form the trigonal planar gallium cyclopentadienyl complex GaCp3. Gallium(I) forms complexes with arene ligands such as hexamethylbenzene. Because this ligand is quite bulky, the structure of the Ga(η6-C6Me6)+ is that of a half-sandwich. Less bulky ligands such as mesitylene allow two ligands to be attached to the central gallium atom in a bent sandwich structure. Benzene is even less bulky and allows the formation of dimers: an example is Ga(η6-C6H6)2 GaCl4·3C6H6.

[[Germanium compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Germanium, Germanium compounds, Chemical compounds by element

Germanium compounds are chemical compounds formed by the element germanium (Ge). Germanium is insoluble in dilute acids and alkalis but dissolves slowly in hot concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids and reacts violently with molten alkalis to produce germanates (GeO). Germanium occurs mostly in the oxidation state +4 although many +2 compounds are known. Other oxidation states are rare: +3 is found in compounds such as Ge2Cl6, and +3 and +1 are found on the surface of oxides, or negative oxidation states in germanides, such as −4 in Mg. Germanium cluster anions (Zintl ions) such as Ge42−, Ge94−, Ge92−, (Ge9)26− have been prepared by the extraction from alloys containing alkali metals and germanium in liquid ammonia in the presence of ethylenediamine or a cryptand. The oxidation states of the element in these ions are not integers—similar to the ozonides O3−.

==Chalcogenides==

===Oxides===

Two oxides of germanium are known: germanium dioxide (GeO, germania) and germanium monoxide, (GeO). The dioxide, GeO2 can be obtained by roasting germanium disulfide (GeS) or by allowing elemental germanium to slowly oxidze in air, and is a white powder that is only slightly soluble in water but reacts with alkalis to form germanates. The monoxide, germanous oxide, can be obtained by the high temperature reaction of GeO2 with Ge metal. The dioxide (and the related oxides and germanates) exhibits the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light, but transparency to infrared light. Bismuth germanate, Bi4Ge3O12, (BGO) is used as a scintillator.

===Other chalcogenides===

Binary compounds with other chalcogens are also known, such as the disulfide (GeS), diselenide (GeSe), and the monosulfide (GeS), selenide (GeSe), and telluride (GeTe). GeS2 forms as a white precipitate when hydrogen sulfide is passed through strongly acid solutions containing Ge(IV). The disulfide is appreciably soluble in water and in solutions of caustic alkalis or alkaline sulfides. Nevertheless, it is not soluble in acidic water, which allowed Winkler to discover the element. By heating the disulfide in a current of hydrogen, the monosulfide (GeS) is formed, which sublimes in thin plates of a dark color and metallic luster, and is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis. Upon melting with alkaline carbonates and sulfur, germanium compounds form salts known as thiogermanates.

==Hydrides==

Germane (GeH4) is a compound similar in structure to methane. Polygermanes—compounds that are similar to alkanes—with formula GenH2n+2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3− anion. The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.

==Halides==

Four tetrahalides are known. Under normal conditions GeI4 is a solid, GeF4 a gas and the others volatile liquids. For example, germanium tetrachloride, GeCl4, is obtained as a colorless fuming liquid boiling at 83.1 °C by heating the metal with chlorine. All the tetrahalides are readily hydrolyzed to hydrated germanium dioxide. GeCl4 is used in the production of organogermanium compounds. All four dihalides are known and in contrast to the tetrahalides are polymeric solids. Additionally Ge2Cl6 and some higher compounds of formula GenCl2n+2 are known. The unusual compound Ge6Cl16 has been prepared that contains the Ge5Cl12 unit with a neopentane structure.

==Organogermanium compounds==

The first organogermanium compound was synthesized by Winkler in 1887; the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with diethylzinc yielded tetraethylgermane (Ge(C). Organogermanes of the type R4Ge (where R is an alkyl) such as tetramethylgermane (Ge(CH) and tetraethylgermane are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor germanium tetrachloride and alkyl nucleophiles. Organic germanium hydrides such as isobutylgermane ((CH) were found to be less hazardous and may be used as a liquid substitute for toxic germane gas in semiconductor applications. Many germanium reactive intermediates are known: germyl free radicals, germylenes (similar to carbenes), and germynes (similar to carbynes). The organogermanium compound 2-carboxyethylgermasesquioxane was first reported in the 1970s, and for a while was used as a dietary supplement and thought to possibly have anti-tumor qualities.

Using a ligand called Eind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl) germanium is able to form a double bond with oxygen (germanone). Germanium hydride and alkylgermanes are very flammable and even explosive when mixed with air.

[[Arsenic compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Arsenic compounds, Arsenic, Chemical compounds by element

Compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of phosphorus which occupies the same group (column) of the periodic table. The most common oxidation states for arsenic are: −3 in the arsenides, which are alloy-like intermetallic compounds, +3 in the arsenites, and +5 in the arsenates and most organoarsenic compounds. Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As4 ions in the mineral skutterudite. In the +3 oxidation state, arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the lone pair of electrons.

==Inorganic compounds==

One of the simplest arsenic compound is the trihydride, the highly toxic, flammable, pyrophoric arsine (AsH3). This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300 °C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid. Several factors, such as humidity, presence of light and certain catalysts (namely aluminium) facilitate the rate of decomposition. It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with sulfur and selenium instead of oxygen.

Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, crystalline oxides As2O3 ("white arsenic") and As2O5 which are hygroscopic and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions. Arsenic(V) acid is a weak acid and the salts are called arsenates, the most common arsenic contamination of groundwater, and a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include Scheele's Green (cupric hydrogen arsenate, acidic copper arsenate), calcium arsenate, and lead hydrogen arsenate. These three have been used as agricultural insecticides and poisons.

The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between phosphate and phosphoric acid. Unlike phosphorous acid, arsenous acid is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH)3.

A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known. Orpiment (As2S3) and realgar (As4S4) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In As4S10, arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in As4S4 which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still 3. Both orpiment and realgar, as well as As4S3, have selenium analogs; the analogous As2Te3 is known as the mineral kalgoorlieite, and the anion As2Te− is known as a ligand in cobalt complexes.

All trihalides of arsenic(III) are well known except the astatide, which is unknown. Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5) is the only important pentahalide, reflecting the lower stability of the +5 oxidation state; even so, it is a very strong fluorinating and oxidizing agent. (The pentachloride is stable only below −50 °C, at which temperature it decomposes to the trichloride, releasing chlorine gas.)

==Alloys==

Arsenic is used as the group 15 element in the III-V semiconductors gallium arsenide, indium arsenide, and aluminium arsenide. The valence electron count of GaAs is the same as a pair of Si atoms, but the band structure is completely different which results in distinct bulk properties. Other arsenic alloys include the II-V semiconductor cadmium arsenide.

==Organoarsenic compounds==

A large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known. Several were developed as chemical warfare agents during World War I, including vesicants such as lewisite and vomiting agents such as adamsite. Cacodylic acid, which is of historic and practical interest, arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry.  Cacodyl was the first organometallic compound known (even though arsenic is not a true metal) and was named from the Greek κακωδία "stink" for its offensive odor; it is very poisonous.

John Joseph Bergen (August 7, 1896 – December 11, 1980) was an American businessman who served as chairman of the Madison Square Garden Corporation.

==Early life==

Bergen was born to Thomas D. and Ellen Bergen on August 7, 1896, in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, where his father owned a coal mine. He began his business career at the age of 16, when he hired some friends to sell furniture polish created by a chemist friend. Through his father he got to know General Motors president William C. Durant, who had a policy on personally calling all GM car owners. Durant hired Bergen as an office boy.

==Military service==

On June 3, 1918, Bergen enlisted in the Naval Reserve Force as a Chief Machinist's Mate. After training on the USS Granite State, he was sent to France, where he piloted seaplanes in Brest, France. He returned to the United States on November 15, 1918, and was placed on inactive status on December 3, 1918. He received an honorable discharge on September 30, 1921.

Bergen remained involved in aviation after the war, financing Wooster and Davis's unsuccessful transatlantic flight and sponsoring the construction of Newark Airport.

Bergen returned to the Naval Reserve as a Lieutenant on July 16, 1926. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on June 8, 1938. On May 18, 1942, was called to active duty. He was soon promoted to Commander and assigned to the Secretary of the Navy's office. After completing a course at the Naval War College, he reported to Commander Fleet Air, South Pacific. From December 1943 to March 1944 he served at the Naval Station Puget Sound. In April 1944 he was made Chief of Staff and Public Relations Officer to the Commandant of the Base. He was detached for terminal leave on August 27, 1944, and released on inactive status three months later.

Bergen returned to the reserve after the war, retiring with the rank of Rear Admiral. He was awarded the World War I Victory Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, and Naval Reserve Medal.

==Business career==

In 1922, Bergen became president of the Flint Motor Company. He then served as a district manager of Durant Motors. Bergen was also a business associate of Eddie Dowling and helped finance Shadow and Substance and The White Steed.

In 1927, Bergen started his own wholesale underwriting firm, the John J. Bergen & Company. John J. Bergen & Company underwrote stock for Grumman, Willys-Overland, United Aircraft, Bank of America, and General Instrument. In 1941, John J. Bergen & Company purchased 57% of Gar Wood Industries. 

Bergen served as chairman of Gar Wood Industries, Louis Sherry Inc., Childs Company, Graham-Paige, New Haven Clock and Watch, Hotel Corporation of America, and Royal American Corporation. From 1952 to 1955 he was president of Graham-Paige. In 1960, Bergen lost his bid for Washington D.C.'s American League expansion team to Elwood Richard Quesada.

In 1959, Graham-Paige purchased controlling interest in Madison Square Garden from James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz. Bergen served as chairman of Madison Square Garden and president of the New York Rangers. Under his leadership, plans began for a new Madison Square Garden. In 1962, Graham-Paige changed its name to the Madison Square Garden Corporation. Bergen resigned from Madison Square Garden Corporation on April 6, 1962. He was succeeded as chairman by Irving Mitchell Felt and as Rangers president by William M. Jennings but stayed on as a director.

Bergen died on December 11, 1980, at his daughter's home in Cuernavaca. He was 85 years old.

Lina Eichler (born 2002) is a German climate activist and a prominent member of the Last Generation. She has been a hunger striker and involved with a wide variety of acts of disruption to bring attention to the climate change emergency.

==Life==

Eichler was born in about 2002 and she is from North Rhine-Westphalia. At a time when she was scheduled to complete her high school graduation she decided to drop out and devote herself to activism. She came to notice as a member of "The Last Generation" who went on hunger strike (Hungerstreik der letzten Generation ) to attract attention to the group's concerns about climate change. They demanded meetings with key candidates for the German Chancellorship, and a citizen's assembly to find ways to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. The group considered the strike to be the last possible peaceful protest. Eichler abandoned the strike after she collapsed after nearly three weeks and she was hospitalised in 2021. The group did get the promise of a meeting with Olaf Scholz which led Henning Jeschke to end the hunger strike.

In 2022 she was among other members of the group gluing themselves to roads to cause disruption. She and other activists dressed themselves up in Chancellor Olaf Scholz costumes, in July 2022, to spill oil in front of the Federal Chancellery. She was arrested for gluing herself to the frame of a painting from the Renaissance and she faces many fines and arrests. She knows that the public do not always support her actions, but she believes that the group are "the fire alarm" and that people may not enjoy fire alarms.

The Last Generation group obtained funding from a group in California to continue to protest against the burning of oil, gas and coal. Eichler and Henning Jeschke were interviewed to celebrate the group's first birthday in September 2022.

Owen Vincent Tracey NZL (15 March 1915 – 8 December 1941) was a New Zealand fighter pilot and flying ace who flew in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He was officially credited with the destruction of at least six enemy aircraft.

Born in Dunedin, Tracey joined the RAF in early 1939. After completing flight training, he was posted to No. 79 Squadron in July 1940. He flew extensively during the Battle of Britain, shooting down a number of German aircraft. In April 1941, he was sent to the Middle East where he flew with No. 274 Squadron. During his time with the squadron, he was involved in the Battle of Crete and in Operation Crusader, in Libya. He was killed when he was shot down during a dogfight with Italian fighters.

==Early life==

Born on 15 March 1915 in Dunedin, New Zealand, Owen Vincent Tracey was the son of Owen Tracey and Margaret Laffey Tracey. He went to school in Auckland, at Monte Cecilia College, and in Oamaru, at St Kevin's College. After completing his education, he worked as a storeman for a firm in Dunedin.

Interested in aviation, Tracey learnt to fly at the Otago Aero Club and in 1937 obtained his 'A' licence with some financial assistance from his mother. He applied twice that year for a short service commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) but was declined, supposedly due to a lack of vacancies. Another application, made in April 1938, was also unsuccessful and he discovered that his school grades were insufficient. He received private tuition from the headmaster of Mosgiel District High School and following this, a subsequent application made later in the year was successful. A scheduled departure in February 1939 for the United Kingdom had to be postponed for health reasons and it was not until the middle of the year that he left New Zealand aboard the SS Rimutaka. Arriving in England on 1 August, he proceeded to No. 19 Elementary & Reserve Flying Training School at RAF Fairoaks shortly afterwards, where he flew de Havilland Tiger Moths.

==Second World War==

Having proceeded to No. 3 Initial Training Wing, the Second World War had broken out by the time Tracey gained his wings. He was granted a short service commission, for four years, and was made an acting pilot officer with effect from 9 October 1939. He went on to No. 3 Service Flying Training School at South Cerney for further training and in late April 1940 was assigned to an instructors course. The following month he went to No. 60 Operational Training Unit to convert to the Hawker Hurricane fighter.

===Battle of Britain===

On 6 July, Tracey was posted to No. 79 Squadron. At the time, his squadron, which operated the Hurricane, was based at Biggin Hill but shortly afterwards moved to RAF Acklington, in the Midlands, forming part of the area's aerial defences. Under the control No. 13 Group, it fought in a number of engagements over the North Sea and in one of these, an interception on 15 August of a large Luftwaffe raid heading for Newcastle, Tracey destroyed a Heinkel He 111 medium bomber.

No. 79 Squadron returned to Biggin Hill on 26 August and was promptly heavily engaged in the aerial battles over London as the Luftwaffe began to focus its efforts on the city. On 28 August, Tracey claimed a He 111 as probably destroyed and also damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. His Hurricane was damaged in the encounter and he landed back at Biggin Hill, just as it was being bombed. Attempting to take off, he had to abort his effort to do so due to his aircraft receiving shrapnel damage from nearby bomb blasts. Although he was unhurt, other RAF personnel were killed in the bombing raid. Two days later, about 20 south of Biggin Hill, he destroyed another He 111. The following day, 31 August, he shot down a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber over Dungeness.

On 5 September Biggin Hill was again targeted by an incoming bomber raid, but No. 79 Squadron was able to intercept it. Tracey claimed a Do 17 as probably destroyed. A few days afterwards the squadron was sent to Pembrey for a rest and refit and from here it resumed operational flying, mostly convoy patrols with the occasional interception of bombing raids on the area around the Bristol Channel. On 21 September, Tracey claimed a Do 17 as probably destroyed 15 west of St David's Head. He was confirmed in his pilot officer rank in November.

===Middle East===

In early 1941, Tracey was assigned to service overseas and, in March, was posted to No. 274 Squadron, at the time based at El Amriya in Egypt. At the time the squadron was resting, having been previously engaged in operations against Italian forces in Libya. The month after his arrival at the squadron, Tracey was promoted to flying officer.

During the Battle of Crete, No. 274 Squadron, based at Gerawla at the time, flew in support of the Allied forces on the island, flying patrols over the shipping in the area and strafing the German forces that had landed on Crete. During this time, on 26 May, Tracey destroyed a Junkers Ju 52 transport plane over Maleme. A Bf 109 then chased him and Tracey went into a dive; while he pulled out, his pursuer did not and crashed into the sea. Tracey was credited with this Bf 109 as an aerial victory. Three days later, while patrolling over the Royal Navy ships evacuating Allied forces from Crete, Tracey shot down a Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber. 

The following month No. 274 Squadron was back to operations over the Western Desert, still flying from Gerawla. Tracey was promoted to flight lieutenant in late August and was appointed one of the squadron's flight commanders. The squadron mostly carried out ground support operations, strafing Axis transports and troops. During Operation Crusader, while flying in the Sidi Rezegh area on 1 December, one of the squadron's Hurricanes, piloted by Lieutenant Hoffe of the South African Air Force, force landed in the desert, close to the Axis ground troops. Tracey made a landing to pick up Hoffe and returned him to base.

On 8 December, No. 274 Squadron was engaged in an escort mission, accompanying Bristol Blenheim light bombers attacking Axis positions to the southwest of El Adem. They encountered German and Italian fighters and engaged them. However, their opposition were soon reinforced and the RAF fighters became outnumbered. Tracey was seen engaging a Macchi C.200 fighter of the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) but his Hurricane received machine gun fire to the cockpit area and dived into the ground, where it burst into flames. Tracey was given a battlefield burial near his crashed aircraft.

Tracey was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the announcement being made in The London Gazette on 6 October 1942. The citation noted Tracey's feat in rescuing Hoffe and also credited him with six enemy aircraft destroyed. Aviation historians Christopher Shores and Clive Wiliams credit him with six German aircraft destroyed, three probably destroyed and one damaged.

After the war, Tracey's remains were reinterred at Halfaya Sollum War Cemetery in Egypt. He was survived by his wife, Frances Slater, who he had married in England, and his son, and they subsequently emigrated to New Zealand and settled in Tracey's home town of Dunedin.

The Estonian Chamber of People with Disabilities (Estonian: Eesti Puuetega Inimeste Koda), also translated as Estonian Chamber of Disabled People, is the largest association of people with disabilities in Estonia. The Chamber functions as a non-profit umbrella organization that represents various organizations of people with disabilities in Estonia since 1993. The objective of the activities of the Estonian Chamber of Persons with Disabilities is to improve the livelihoods, quality of life and social inclusion of people with disabilities.

==History==

The Estonian Chamber of Disabled People was founded in February 1993 and on 27 April 1994 was registered in the business register. It was included in the register of non-profit organizations and foundations on 1 October 1997.

==Board and management==

Four board presidents and seven directors have led the organization. From 2022, Maarja Krais-Leosk is the executive director of the Estonian Chamber of Persons with Disabilities, and Meelis Joost the president of the board.

==International cooperation==

The Estonian Chamber of Persons with Disabilities has been cooperating with the European Disability Forum (EDF) since 2000. In 2001, the Chamber was accepted as an observer member with the right to represent the interests of Estonian people with disabilities in the pan-European umbrella organization. The Chamber became a full member in 2004 after Estonia joined the European Union. The Estonian Chamber of Persons with Disabilities reached the international level largely under the leadership of Meelis Joost, a long-time chief foreign affairs specialist and current president of the board.

Since 2008, the Chamber of Persons with Disabilities of Estonia has been a member of the European Patient Forum (EPF) and cooperates with the European umbrella organization for rare diseases, EURORDIS, where the Chamber is represented by the Estonian Prader Willi Syndrome Association.  The Chamber also shares its experiences with Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine organizations. In addition, the Estonian Chamber of Persons with Disabilities is one of the five founders of the Eesti Agrenska Fond, an Estonian-Swedish joint foundation for children and families with disabilities that has been operating since 2001.

==Members==

The Chamber consists of 16 regional chambers of people with disabilities, 32 unions and national associations for people with specific disabilities and five supporting members. In total, the network represents about 285 organizations of various types and levels.

The organizations of people with disabilities offer training and educational courses. The Estonian Chamber of Disabled People has several sub-organizations such as the Heart Union and Asthma Union, as well as the Union of People with Mental Disabilities. These unions take care of both medical training as well as daily skills and other basic education.

[[Cerium compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Cerium, Cerium compounds, Chemical compounds by element

Cerium compounds are compounds containing the element cerium (Ce), a lanthanide. Cerium exists in two main oxidation states, Ce(III) and Ce(IV). This pair of adjacent oxidation states dominates several aspects of the chemistry of this element. Cerium(IV) aqueous solutions may be prepared by reacting cerium(III) solutions with the strong oxidizing agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, although +1.72 V is representative. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state.

==Halides==

Cerium forms all four trihalides CeX3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) usually by reaction of the oxides with the hydrogen halides.  The anhydrous halides are pale-colored, paramagnetic, hygroscopic solids.  Upon hydration, the trihalides convert to complexes containing aquo complexes Ce(H2O)8-93+.  Unlike most lanthanides, Ce forms a tetrafluoride, a white solid.  It also forms a bronze-colored diiodide, which has metallic properties.

Aside from the binary halide phases, a number of anionic halide complexes are known. Fluoride gives the Ce(IV) derivatives CeF8(4-) and CeF6(2-).  Chloride gives the orange CeCl6(2-).

===Oxides, sulfides, etc.===

Cerium(IV) oxide ("ceria") has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium.  Ceria is a nonstoichiometric compound, meaning that the real formula is CeO2-x, where x is about 0.2.  Thus, the material is not perfectly described as Ce(IV).  Ceria reduces to cerium(III) oxide with hydrogen gas.

Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 compounds are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) derivatives of S, Se, and Te are unknown.

==Cerium(IV) complexes==

The compound ceric ammonium nitrate ("CAN") (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 is the most common cerium compound encountered in the laboratory.  The six nitrate ligands bind as bidentate ligands. The complex Ce(NO3)6(2-) is 12-coordinate, a high coordination number which emphasizes the large size of the Ce4+ ion. CAN is popular oxidant in organic synthesis, both as a stoichiometric reagent and as a catalyst.  It is inexpensive, easily handled.  It operates by one-electron redox. Cerium nitrates also form 4:3 and 1:1 complexes with 18-crown-6 (the ratio referring to that between cerium and the crown ether). 

Classically CAN is a primary standard for quantitative analysis.  Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.

Cerium(III) and terbium(III) have ultraviolet absorption bands of relatively high intensity compared with the other lanthanides, as their configurations (one electron more than an empty or half-filled f-subshell respectively) make it easier for the extra f electron to undergo f→d transitions instead of the forbidden f→f transitions of the other lanthanides. Cerium(III) sulfate is one of the few salts whose solubility in water decreases with rising temperature.

Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidizing agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. 

In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyze the reaction.

==Organocerium compounds==

Organocerium chemistry is similar to that of the other lanthanides, often involving complexes of cyclopentadienyl and cyclooctatetraenyl ligands. Cerocene (Ce(C8H8)2) adopts the uranocene molecular structure. The 4f electron in cerocene, Ce, is poised ambiguously between being localized and delocalized and this compound is also considered intermediate-valent. 

Alkyl, alkynyl, and alkenyl organocerium derivatives are prepared from the transmetallation of the respective organolithium or Grignard reagents, and are more nucleophilic but less basic than their precursors..

[[Erbium compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Erbium, Erbium compounds, Chemical compounds by element

Erbium compounds are compounds containing the element erbium (Er). These compounds are usually dominated by erbium in the +3 oxidation state, although the +2, +1 and 0 oxidation states have also been reported.

==Oxides==

Erbium(III) oxide (also known as erbia) is the only known oxide of erbium, first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843, and first obtained in pure form in 1905 by Georges Urbain and Charles James. It has a cubic structure resembling the bixbyite motif. The Er3+ centers are octahedral. The formation of erbium oxide is accomplished by burning erbium metal. Erbium oxide is insoluble in water and soluble in mineral acids.

==Halides==

Erbium(III) fluoride is a pinkish powder that can be produced by reacting erbium(III) nitrate and ammonium fluoride. It can be used to make infrared light-transmitting materials and up-converting luminescent materials. Erbium(III) chloride is a violet compounds that can be formed by first heating erbium(III) oxide and ammonium chloride to prouce the ammonium salt of the pentachloride (NH42ErCl5) then heating it in a vacuum at 350-400 °C. It forms crystals of the AlCl3 type, with monoclinic crystals and the point group C2/m. Erbium(III) chloride hexahydrate also forms monoclinic crystals with the point group of P2/n (P2/c) - C42h. In this compound, erbium is octa-coordinated to form Er(H2O)6Cl2+ ions with the isolated Cl− completing the structure.

Erbium(III) bromide is a violet solid. It is used, like other metal bromide compounds, in water treatment, chemical analysis and for certain crystal growth applications. Erbium(III) iodide is a slightly pink compound that is insoluble in water. It can be prepared by directly reacting erbium with iodine.

==Borides==

Erbium tetraboride is a boride of erbium. It is hard and has a high melting point. It can be used in semiconductors, the blades of gas turbines, and the nozzles of rocket engines. Erbium hexaboride is another boride of erbium, with a calcium hexaboride structure. It is isostructural with all other rare-earth hexaboride compounds including lanthanum hexaboride, samarium hexaboride, and cerium hexaboride.

==Other compounds==

Erbium(III) hydroxide is a pink solid that decomposes to ErO(OH) at an elevated temperature, then further heating will produce erbium(III) oxide. Erbium(III) phosphide (ErP) is also a pink solid that can be formed by the direct reaction of its constituent elements. It forms crystals of a cubic system, space group Fm3m. Erbium(III) nitrate (Er(NO3)3) forms pink crystals. It is readily soluble in water and forms crystalline hydrates. Erbium(III) acetate is a light pink solid that is used to synthesize some optical materials. The tetrahydrate of erbium(III) acetate is thermally decomposed at 90 °C, giving a proposed anhydride:

Continuing heating to 310 °C will form ketene:

At 350 °C, the proposed Er(OH)(CH3COO)2 loses acetic acid to yield a material of the formula ErOCH3COO, forming Er2O2CO3 at 390 °C, finally obtaining Er2O3 at 590 °C.

==Organoerbium compounds==

Organoerbium compounds are very similar to those of the other lanthanides, as they all share an inability to undergo π backbonding. They are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides (isostructural with those of lanthanum) and the σ-bonded simple alkyls and aryls, some of which may be polymeric.

[[Johann Friedrich Meyer]]

CATEGORIES: 1705 births, 1765 deaths, German chemists

Johann Friedrich Meyer (24 October 1705 – 2 November 1765) was a Thuringian chemist and pharmacist who ardently supported the phlogiston theory even after the work of Joseph Black was published. He contributed greatly to debates in the chemistry of the time although he was wrong, often reviving obsolete ideas from alchemy.

==Biography==

Meyer was born in Osnabrück, to physician Johann Andreas (1670–1714) and Sophia Margaretha née Gottfried (1683–1742). He wished to study theology but was forced to work at the Hirsch pharmacy in Bramsche belonging to his maternal family. After apprenticing there he went to  Leipzig and after periods of unemployment, joined a pharmacy in Nordhausen in 1727. He worked for a while in the pharmacy of the Francke Foundations at Halle and return to his family business in Osnabrück, inheriting its ownership in 1737. He worked there until his death.

Meyer married Anna Sara née Krochmann in 1738 and she died childless in 1759.

==Scientific work==

In 1764, Meyer published a book on his researchers Chymische Versuche zur näheren Erkenntnis des ungelöschten Kalchs in which he claimed that alkaline substances had an element derived from fire called acidum pinque produced by the reaction of acids with fire. He said phlogiston converted calxes into metals while acidum pingue calcined metals (CaCO3 + "acidum pinque" -> CaO). He later called it the theory of causticum and claimed that mild alkalis effervesced by absorbing causticum while caustic alkalis were already saturated with acidum pinque and would not effervesce. Meyer argued against Joseph Black who in 1756 had explained the difference as being between the presence or absence of "fixed air". Meyer's ideas found support with Johann Christian Wiegleb, Karl Wilhelm Pörner, and Antoine Baumé. The subsequent debates and experiments clarified ideas on oxygen and erased his ideas. Nearly 45 books and papers dealt with the controversy in the years between 1764 and 1804.

St. Victor Petroglyphs Provincial Historic Park is an historical provincial park in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The park is located in the RM of Willow Bunch No. 42, about 2 south of St. Victor. The 3.9 park is situated on the northern slope of the Wood Mountain Upland on a cliff at the top of a partially wooded coulee. The Wood Mountain Hills are a plateau east of the Cypress Hills along the Missouri Coteau in the semi-arid Palliser's Triangle. The site was designated an historic site in the 1960s and became a provincial park in 1986.

St. Victor Petroglyphs Provincial Historic Park features over 360 petroglyphs that have been estimated to have been carved between AD 200 and 1750. They are on a large sandstone outcrop and are the only known example of horizontal petroglyphs on the Canadian Prairies. They also represent the largest concentration of pre-contact rock art in Saskatchewan.

==History==

There is evidence that the petroglyphs were not carved all at one time but rather over a period of hundreds of years by different people as there are a few examples of carvings superimposed on carvings. It is not known exactly who carved them but this rock art is typically attributed to the people of the Siouan languages. There are carved animal tracks, animal and human figures, geometric shapes, and genitalia. "The association of vulva forms with cloven-hoofed animal tracks relates to Siouan mythological themes of fertility and the sacred relationship between women and bison". The petroglyphs were likely created as part of rituals and focused on productivity of game animals, curing, and vision-seeking.

==The petroglyphs today==

First Nations today still consider the site sacred. The natural erosion of the sandstone is causing the petroglyphs to fade and the erosion of the cliff has caused a large piece of carved sandstone, bearing a dozen carvings, to break away. Different First Nations individuals and groups have expressed differing views regarding preservation of the carvings, including taking active measures, versus "letting nature take its course". The province has chosen the latter stance despite international conventions that encourage preservation of rock art for the education and enjoyment of future generations. To slow vandalism and wear and tear from foot traffic, the province has blocked access to the carvings by erecting a fence. Several interpretive plaques are located outside the fence. In the nearby community of St. Victor,  the St. Victor Petroglyphs Interpretative Centre, established and operated by Friends of St. Victor Petroglyphs, presents profesionally-prepared interpretive panels and other displays on the petroglyphs, and the Friends offer guided tours of the site. The main authoritative source on these petroglyphs is the book published by the Friends: St.Victor Petroglyphs: The Place of the Living Stone.

[[Far Sector]]

CATEGORIES: Works by N. K. Jemisin, Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story-winning works

Far Sector is a miniseries in the DC Comics Green Lantern franchise, published from 2019 to 2021 by DC's imprint DC's Young Animal. The Green Lantern of the series is Sojourner Mullein, created by science fiction and fantasy writer N. K. Jemisin. Far Sector won the 2022 Hugo Award for "Best Graphic Story or Comic".  Far Sector also received several more award nominations: three Eisner Awards nominations, a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book nomination, and an Ignyte Award. The series has an average critic rating of 8.7 out of 10 based on 169 reviews on the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup.

==Plot Summary==

Far Sector takes place on a Dyson swarm called the City Enduring. The City is divided into several platforms. It is home to 20 billion members from three species: the winged Nah; the plant-based keh-Topli, who occasionally engage in reverent and consensual consumption of sentient species; and the @At, digital beings who can take physical form using light projectors. The three species initially lived on two separate planets until the Burnover, when they destroyed their homeworlds during a war sparked by the Cloud Kratocracy (an empire of powerful alien conquerors that the three species drove to extinction). To prevent further conflict, the three species bioengineered a virus called the Emotion Exploit to tone down their emotions. Although it limited their ability to create entertainment, the Exploit prevented them from making rash and destructive decisions. They then came together to create the City from the remains of their planets.  Since then, the three species have lived peacefully under the rule of the Trilogy Council for centuries. The Trilogy Council consists of one member of each species; they are elected by their respective species, their position is lifelong, and their power is unrestricted. 

In Platform Ever Forward, a district of the City, the first murder in 500 years has occurred. An autopsy and an analysis of the suspect’s stomach contents show that the victim, Stevn of the Glacier, was eaten. Sojourner “Jo” Mullein and Peace Accountant Syzn discuss the murder with the Council, consisting of the Nah Marth, the @At @Blaze-of-Glory, and the keh-Topli Averrup. They believe that the keh-Topli suspect, Meile Thorn, was under the influence of Switchoff, a drug that nullifies the Emotion Exploit. After the council meeting concludes, Jo goes to see Meile. Upon entering Meile’s jail cell, Jo discovers that Meile has just been killed, and the Nah perpetrator flees the cell. Sojourner pursues the Nah, but fails to capture her.

Jo goes to Marth’s home to ask him for contact information so she can speak to Stevn's family. During their meeting, Marth makes multiple romantic gestures and reveals that he and Council members in the past have taken Switchoff.

The next day, Syzn messages Jo asking her to quell an unapproved protest of over a hundred thousand people in Platform Forget Not. The protest consists of Switchoff users, who want the Exploit abolished, and counter-protestors who want Switchoff banned and the Emotion Exploit to be kept active. Jo calms down the protestors by promising to give the Council the Switchoff users’ viewpoints, but Marth orders firing on the protestors in order to “keep the peace”. Jo uses her powers to shield the unarmed protestors, minimizing fatalities, and chastises the Peace Division officers for their attack.

After the protest, An, Stevn's wife, signals Jo. She reveals that she organized the protest, believing her husband wouldn't have died if the keh-Topli who ate him had the opportunity to learn to regulate her emotions so Meile could have learned to control her desire safely. They demand that Jo presents their demand to the Council or the protests will continue even with the threat of being killed by the Peace Department.

The next day, Jo brings the protestors’ concerns to the Council. The Council, believing that the Switchoff epidemic is out of control and knowing that murder and civil unrest have occurred the previous twelve times citizens called for an end of the Exploit, has turned their focus from preventing additional murders to preventing dissolution of the City at any cost. Jo swears that as long as she’s around, she will protect the City from the violence of the Council.

A week later, the Council formally apologies for their deadly use of force and sets a date for a referendum on the Exploit. Jo searches through information about purchasing Switchoff, but the drug is purchased from throwaway companies using untraceable cryptocurrencies. Canhaz, Jo’s assistant, mentions that she and many other @At have spent years mining cryptocurrency when times were rough. This leads Jo to remember her life on Earth where she joined the army and then the police force in an attempt to make the world a fairer place. A Guardian praised Jo for her commitment to justice and reporting her partner for police brutality before her firing, and offered her a position as a Green Lantern.

Jo meets with An again, who knows that the Council will likely ignore the demands of the people but the protestors will fight for change anyway. The discussion reignites Jo’s concerns that she is being used by the Council to uphold the status quo instead of protecting the City’s people. Jo gets a call from Averrup, who believes that Meile was not acting out of her own volition when she ate Stevn, as she was a strict vegetarian and much of Stevn’s body remained.

Three days later,  Marth comes to Jo’s apartment to apologize for his order and to reveal that he will resign from his position after the referendum. He also tells her that he takes Switchoff to reflect on the decisions he makes as a Councilor under the Exploit. The two talk further discuss Marth’s experiences with Switchoff, then make out and have intercourse.

The morning after, Averrup calls Jo and asks her to immediately come to his location. Jo calls Syzn for backup, then she and Canhaz fly to a wholesale warehouse in Platform Ever Forward. Jo enters the building and is attacked by armor machines from the long defunct Cloud Kratocracy. The machines are piloted by Nah and keh-Topli pilots, including an unresponsive Averrup. Canhaz suspects that the pilot’s bodies have been killed and taken over by @At, who can control biological beings by taking over their nervous systems. An outraged Jo destroys the machines. Canhaz detects that the @At have escaped the pilot’s bodies into the City Network, the City’s equivalent to the internet. Jo uses her ring to enter the City Network with Canhaz to track down the @At pilots in Atville. After exploring Atville, the two confront and capture the three suspects. When interrogated, the suspects reveal that they had little knowledge of the details behind their job. They state that they were tasked with taking over Meile’s body under the request of their anonymous employer and were instructed to kill anyone using her body. 

Havesh Stump replaces Averrup as the Councilor. He questions if it is proper for the emotional Jo to carry on the investigation, while Blaze-of-Glory believes that the @At suspects were being exploited by the returning Clout Kratocracy. Jo storms out of the Council meeting, accusing the Council of not taking responsibility and for not letting her do her job.  Marth apologizes for the Council’s behavior and tells Jo to look up the Feelsnet.

The next day, Jo and Canhaz are at a diner. Canhaz states that due to their dependence on digital media for nutrition and currency, the @At originally voted against the Exploit. She also notes that the majority of the other two races didn’t want it either, but the Nah Councilor of the time secretly applied it to the whole city. Canhaz then tells her that the Feelsnet is used for the exchange of illegal or scarce content, particularly memes made by residents of the City. Jo realizes that Switchoff users are being used as a black market commodity since they become emotional enough to produce creative content.

Jo goes to Platform Solid Ground to investigate a tip from Marth. Syzn doubts Marth’s trustworthiness, and warns Jo about the risk she’s taking, as Jo’s ring is still low on power after the trip to Atville and Jo has refused backup. Jo flies to what appears to be a secret military facility. She knocks out a guard, takes their clothing, and sneaks into the building. She finds out that the building is a sweatshop-like facility filled with residents who are forced to take Switchoff to produce intellectual property and are collared to prevent escape.

Jo is captured by security guards after she reveals herself as the Green Lantern to fight guards forcibly giving Switchoff to a resident. Syzn meets Jo in the CEPD headquarters, asking Jo to plead “temporary emotional insanity” as an explanation for her actions, and tells her that dealing with the Switchoff facilities is too complicated to take care of before tomorrow’s Exploit referendum. Jo realizes that Meile was one of the residents, and was used by Switchoff dealers after she escaped to set an example. She commands Syzn to not let the sweatshops or the murders be swept under the rug because of the Council’s apathy.

Syzn allows Marth to visit Jo the next morning. With help from Canhaz and the CEPD, Jo has figured out that Marth owns the sweatshop (as well as multiple others) and is the main funder of Switchoff production. Marth explains that his ancestor was the one who imposed the Exploit, and while it served its purpose in the past, he wants to end it without disrupting the status quo so much that fortunes and power are disrupted. He is using the facilities to fund a revolution, and gave Jo the “tip” so she could investigate if the facility she entered wasn’t using voluntary residents like the others. He and Averrup asked for a Green Lantern so they could use her to encourage support for the referendum. Syzn comes in to arrest Marth for trafficking and conspiracy to murder under Glory’s request. Canhaz calls Jo to tell her that the Council has shut down half of the referendum voting servers, limiting the ability to vote, especially for the @At. Jo, Canhaz, and Marth enter the Council chambers to confront Glory, who has ordered the military to fire on rioters angry at their ability to vote being impeded (although they refuse to do so). Glory explains that she was waiting for the referendum since the CEPD’s forces would be spread thin so she could take control of a military and use force against the biological civilians.

The chamber is suddenly rocked by an explosion. Lumir, the Council’s seneshall and an anti-Exploit supporter, states that it is an antibomb (small weapons of mass destruction that release antimatter pulses) and more will go off all over the City if the referendum servers don’t come back online. Since the illegal weapons are powerful enough to destroy the solar radiation-blocking shields that surround the City, Marth begs Glory to call off her coup so citizens don’t resort to wiping themselves out to be free of the Exploit. Glory, certain that @At can survive the bombings, severely injures Marth and continues. Jo damages a projector, preventing Glory from being able to manifest physically to make it difficult for her to command the military. Meanwhile, An’s rebel group and members of the CEPD fight the military to protect the screen generators while the digital @At prevent Glory from launching a cyberattack. Marth reveals that he used the money he made from selling Switchoff to hire the remainders of the Cloud Kratocracy as a contingency plan since he suspected Glory to be planning something.

Jo goes to fight off the Kratocracy fleet. The Widening Chasm, a City spaceship, is shooting at the City, so she damages and enters it. She meets with the captain, Marth’s sister Minec. Jo asks CanHaz to broadcast their conversion to the surrounding ships, then criticizes Minec for her willingness to follow Glory’s orders. Minec responds that she’s only acting logically, as the situation of the City is completely out of control. Jo states that the City’s problem isn’t rooted in emotion, but rather the distribution of power, and fighting for order rather than justice isn’t making the world a better place. Minec, agreeing with Jo, declares a ceasefire. 

The servers come back online allowing voting to be completed; the referendum passes with a clear majority in favor of ending the Exploit, and the Council honors the result. Glory is imprisoned and awaiting trial for treason while Stump is forced out of the Council. Marth, being the only council member left, has his resignation postponed. New councilors will be elected within three months. Plans for the gradual transition off of the Exploit are being made. Jo and Syzn (the latter trying Switchoff for the first time) have a picnic together. When Jo returns to her apartment, CanHaz gives her a letter from her father back on Earth. Jo reminisces on her time in the City, realizing how much she loves it and wonders what her next six months assigned there will be like. The story concludes with her reciting the Green Lantern Oath.

[[Thomas Purchase]]

CATEGORIES: People of colonial Maine, King Philip's War, King William's War, 1577 births, 1678 deaths, People from Dorchester, Dorset, English emigrants to the United States, Pejepscot, Maine

Thomas Purchase (1577–1678), also known as Thomas Purchis and Thomas Purchas, was the first English settler to occupy the region of Pejepscot, Maine in what is now Brunswick, Topsham and Harpswell. In 1628 he set up a trading post at the site of Fort Andross to barter with the local Wabanaki Native Americans.

==Early life==

Thomas Purchase was born in 1577 at Dorchester, Dorset, England, to Oliver Purchase and Thomesin (Harris) Purchase.

On August 6, 1613, a fire broke out in Dorchester, burning down 170 homes, setting the impetus for the future colonization movement of Massachusetts that led to the Massachusetts Bay Company. In the years after the first fire, the town was plagued with overpopulation. By the time of the next fire in 1622, John White, a Puritan minister, convinced the people of Dorchester to start a new company and head to the New World. The name of this group of investors was called the Dorchester Company. When the company failed, the original investors were part of the group that formed the Massachusetts Bay Company.23-24

==Settling in Maine==

Although it is unknown which ship carried Purchase to North America or the exact date, it is documented that he made a return trip from England in 1629. He boarded the ship The Lyon (not to be confused with Lyon's Whelp), leaving Bristol England on April 5, along with five other ships, arriving in Salem, Massachusetts. He was 53 years old. 

Purchase was the first English settler in what is now called Brunswick, Maine. Before it was incorporated into a town in 1739, the region was known by the Wabanaki Native Americans as Pejepscot (long, rocky rapids part), encompassing the current towns of Brunswick, Topsham, and Harpswell, Maine.

In 1628, Purchase settled in Saco, Maine, then in Pejepscot. He became acquainted with the value of the land which he afterward acquired. On June 16, 1632, the Plymouth Company granted a patent to Purchase and his  brother-in-law George Way.789-790

With this new deed, Purchase set up a trading post, where the natives already had one, to buy and sell goods, mainly salmon, sturgeon and furs on a section of the Androscoggin River known as Pejepscot Falls, adjacent to the Site of Fort Andross.

The location of Thomas Purchase's residence in Brunswick is unclear, but one of his homes where he cured fish may have been located near a lot on Water Street in Brunswick, located near Captain Daniel Stone's estate.790-791

On August 22, 1639, he made a legal conveyance to John Winthrop, Governor of Massachusetts, of all his land and put himself under the jurisdiction of that colony.794

Throughout his time at Pejepscot, Purchase was a fisherman, hunter, trader and raised cattle. He bartered with the natives and other settlers with a rich stock of salmon, sturgeon, and shad, as well as wildlife game. Purchase had a monopoly on the area and would cure and pack fish for export to London. He was also a farmer cultivating soil and had enough maize to store for the winter.79372

==King Philip's War==

In 1675, King Philip's War between Native Americans and New England colonists broke out. By September of that year, hostilities commenced at Pejepscot. A party of twenty natives went to Purchase's house and pretended to his wife that they wished to trade. Discovering that her husband and son were absent, they robbed the house. Purchase's son returned home while this happened and fled for his life. The following year Purchase's house was burned by the natives.49-50

With the destruction of his home, Purchase lost the only copy of the patent that held his property. The original had been left with Mr. Francis Ashley in England. Soon after this fire, along with other settlers, he moved to a nearby island where they waited for a ship to take them to Lynn, Massachusetts, where he lived the rest of his life.79375

==Family and death==

Thomas Purchase was married twice. His first wife was Mary Gove. The marriage occurred in 1631; Gove died in Boston on January 7, 1656. His second marriage, in 1657, was to Elizabeth Williams; they had five children together, four daughters and one son. Their children were Thomas Purchase Jr., Jane Purchase, Elizabeth Purchase, and two unnamed daughters. Thomas Purchase, Jr. was reported lost at sea in 1685.792

The Probate court at Lynn, Massachusetts, dates Thomas Purchase's death to 1678, at 101 years old.788

Bronius Krivickas (17 November 1919 – 21 September 1952) was a Lithuanian writer, poet, literary critic, and anti-Soviet partisan. His work is mainly characterized by satire and literary criticism against the occupying Soviet state. Amongst the partisans he was also widely known by his codename Vilnius.

Having enjoyed writing at an early age, Krivickas studied Lithuanian and French languages and literature at the Vytautas Magnus University. He participated in the activities of Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas's Šatrija art circle and Balys Sruoga's theater seminar. Krivickas established himself as a literary and theater critic, as well as poet and novella writer, and also developed a friendship with Mamertas Indriliūnas. He joined the Lithuanian partisan movement in 1945 and participated in their activities as a communicator, being dubbed by fellow partisans as "the professor" until his death in 1952 when he was found hiding in a bunker and subsequently executed. Krivickas and his works were one of the main voices of anti-Soviet resistance.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Bronius Krivickas was born on 17 November 1919 in the Pervalkai village of the Pasvalys District. Born in a family of peasants, Krivickas had six siblings, three sisters and three brothers. In 1929, the family moved to the Kiauliškės village in the Biržai District as Krivickas' parents sold their farm for a bigger one.

Krivickas went to the Suostas primary school, and in 1938 he finished the Antanas Smetona gymnasium in Biržai, in which he read his works in social literary evenings and once even won the prize of 30 litai in an essay contest. The same year Krivickas started to study at the Vytautas Magnus University at the faculty of theology and philosophy, specifically Lithuanian and French language and literature.

In the university he joined the Šatrija art circle, a group of writers with Christian-leaning views, overseen by the writer Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas in whose conventions Krivickas met many Lithuanian writers. Krivickas also was a part of the theatre seminar headed by the writer Balys Sruoga. From 1938 he wrote short novellas which appeared in the newspapers Ateitis and Studentų dienos (which he also edited). Krivickas was also friends with Mamertas Indriliūnas, a fellow writer and partisan.

===Activity in Vilnius===

When Lithuania received the capital Vilnius after the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty in 1939, Krivickas and his colleagues moved there to study at Vilnius University, participating in various social activities and establishing himself as a theatre critic. In 1943, he completed his studies, however the university was shut down in the same year due to the Nazi occupation. To continue earning money and out of fear of being sent to Germany for work, from 1944 he assisted in editing the newspapers Naujoji Romuva, Darbininkas, Kūryba, XX amžius. On 1 October 1944, he briefly became a teacher at the Biržai gymnasium as Lithuania had a shortage of teachers. However, he started getting called to the NKVD headquarters, and fearing arrest, he subsequently went into hiding.

===Activity as a partisan===

In February 1945, he joined the partisan movement in the same outskirts in which two of his brothers also were active. In the same year, his brother Juozas was killed and their parents were driven out from their homes with the homestead burned. From 1947 to 1948, Krivickas would stay in bunkers, such as his wife's parents' homestead bunker in Tylinava in the winters, and would hide in the forests in the summers. In 1948, a priest in Suostas quietly wed Krivickas and a school teacher from Smilgiai. Krivickas belonged to the partisan Eastern Lithuanian (King Mindaugas) Area, for which he edited partisan newspapers.The partisans reportedly respected Krivickas. Working as a communicator between them, intensely studying languages, keeping a large amount of books in his bunkers, and also briefly being the second-in-command of another partisan squad led by Petras Tupėnas, Krivickas was known as "the professor". Krivickas used to seclude himself, write poems, and then recite them by the fire in the evening for fellow partisans.

===Final years and death===

Under fear of his wife being persecuted, Krivickas moved to the partisans in Biržai. This period was the most creatively productive for him, as he notably translated 80 of Goethe's poems and wrote numerous sonnets. As the number of partisans increasingly lowered, from 1951 Bronius found himself in the eastern Lithuanian partisan headquarters editing the newspapers Aukštaičių kova and Laisvės kova.

On 21 September 1952, not being able to resist interrogation, the area commander Jonas Kimštas was forced to reveal the location of the eastern headquarters. About a thousand soldiers surrounded the forest of Raguva, and after finding one of the three bunkers in which Krivickas hid, they executed him immediately.

In 1953, the last remaining partisan brother, Jonas, was killed in the forest of Skaistkalnis.

==Literary style==

At the time of studying, he established himself as a critic, novelist, and dramaturg. Krivickas upheld the strict aesthetic qualities of his critical literature throughout his literary career. Krivickas's short stories are characterized by psychologically resilient characters and philosophical undertones. His poetry mainly focused on a person's relationship with existence, the world, and death.

Krivickas's first poem from the partisan period is dated 1945. At first, his works, which were poems, sonnets, and satires, were only spread by word of mouth or transcripts among the partisans or their supporters. His work was characterized by the promotion of classical values, as well as heroism and the fearlessness of death, which were values he himself upheld. Because of his time as a partisan, many of his works include describing the life of living with partisans – hiding in bunkers and forests, the death of close friends and family, and most importantly – leaving the last bullet to yourself. Some of his works are characterized by religion as in multiple poems he mentions the wrath of god, describing also that through pain and death one can achieve peace and come to god. His satires included elements of grotesque and absurdism, and in them he chooses to mock the Soviet government and reveal the truth of its occupation, propaganda, and cruelty, also ironizing the supposed "allies" of the Soviet Union.

Krivickas compared the partisan struggle for freedom with the Israelite fight for the promised land and various other heroic medieval tales. In such context, however, Krivickas realizes that there is very little hope, and embraces a stoic mindset in his poems, which are now one of his most famous works, Pralaimėjimas, Migla, Partizano mirtis, and Deividas prieš Goliatą (David versus Goliath).

==Legacy==

Krivickas is mainly remembered as a poet-partisan.

His surviving works and pictures are displayed at the Maironis Museum of Lithuanian Literature.

[[Grupa Marina Škrgatića]]

CATEGORIES: Croatian progressive rock groups, Yugoslav progressive rock groups, Musical groups established in 1970

Grupa Marina Škrgatića (transl. Marin Škrgatić Band) was a Yugoslav progressive rock band formed in Zagreb in 1970. Fronted by vocalist and trombonist Marin Škrgatić, the group was a prominent act of the 1970s Yugoslav rock scene.

==Band history==

===1970 – mid-1970s===

The band was formed in 1970 in Zagreb. The forming members of the band were Marin Škrgatić (formerly of Soul Soul Band, vocals and trombone), Mladen Leib (guitar, bassoon), Branko Kezele (bass guitar, clarinet), Dragan Brčić (drums, viola) and Miro Matošević (percussion, oboe). During the following years Rajko Dujmić (organ, electric violin), Vladimir Georgev (bass guitar) and Hrvoje Galeković (drums) also performed with the band.

Soon after the formation the band attracted the attention of the audience and the media with their avant-garde approach to rock music. Only several months after the formation, they got the opportunity to make recordings for Radio Zagreb. During the early 1970s they presented themselves to the audience in major centers of Yugoslav rock scene: in Ljubljana they performed on the initial editions of BOOM Festival, in Belgrade they performed on the concerts organized by Pop Mašina in Belgrade Sports Hall, and in Zagreb they held regular club performances. In 1973 the band released their debut record, the 7-inch single with the songs "Beži Janke" ("Get Away, Janke") and "Vjeruj" ("Believe") through Suzy record label.

True Russia (tr ; Nastoyashchaya Rossiya) is a charity  opposed to  Russia's military attack on Ukraine by uniting people of Russian culture around the world in their will to support the victims.  It was founded by writer Boris Akunin, dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and economist Sergei Guriev. The project is dedicated to helping Ukrainian refugees, as well as people who were forced to leave Russia after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.  The project's website emphasizes that it is not a political movement and not affiliated with any party or politician.

==History==

The project was organized on 9 March 2022, when fundraising began to help Ukrainian refugees.

On 17 March, in an interview with the BBC, Akunin said that the project is primarily focused on the Russian diaspora, on the people, and that participation in any pacifist and even more so pro-Ukrainian campaigns now poses a certain risk for Russians living in Russia.

After Akunin announced his anti-war position, stores began to withdraw his book from sale.

On 24 May, the project website was blocked by Roskomnadzor by decision of the Prosecutor-General's Office of the Russian Federation.

In July, it was reported that the organization had raised more than £1 million to help refugees.

Despite the tournament refers to itself as if it was played between two different years, the tournament starts and ends on 2022, as the "–23" refers to the Japan professional women's football season on the WE League, which starts in 2022 and (actually) ends on 2023.

[[Tassilo Wallentin]]

CATEGORIES: 21st-century Austrian lawyers, Austrian columnists, 1973 births, Living people, Politicians from Vienna, 21st-century Austrian politicians

Tassilo Wallentin (born 25 December 1973 in Vienna) is an Austrian author, columnist, and lawyer. He was an independent candidate for President of Austria in the 2022 election.

==Life and profession==

Wallentin graduated from Catholic school in Floridsdorf in Vienna. He then completed compulsory military service as a one-year volunteer with the alpine troops and began studying jurisprudence at the University of Salzburg in 1994. He completed his doctoral studies in 1998 and worked as a university assistant at the Institute for Austrian and International Commercial and Economic Law. He then studied in the United States, obtaining a Master of Laws degree and worked for a law firm in San Francisco. After returning to Austria, practicing law in Vienna, and passing the bar exam, Wallentin founded his own law firm in 2004.

Wallentin rose to prominence in 2004 after securing the acquittal of two construction industry directors who had operated hundreds of shell companies. In his defence, he cited a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice which ruled that intentional withdrawal of share capital from a company was not illegal since the funds were transferred, if only for a "legal second", to the founding account. Wallentin successfully argued that the defendants had not technically filed false reports to the commercial court, since the state of the accounts during that "legal second" was legally valid. Combined with a 1999 European Court of Justice ruling on the freedom to establish companies across borders, the case set an EU-wide legal precedent that companies are only liable for damages up to the basic founding fee of 100 euro, necessitating amendment to regulations to re-criminalise corporate fraud.

Shortly after, Wallentin began representing Hans Dichand, the founder, publisher, and editor-in-chief of the Neue Kronen Zeitung, in a number of legal cases, particularly against the WAZ Media Group. This included media arbitration proceedings as well as pressing damages claims after the discontinuation of the newspaper U-Express. During the foundation of Dichand's new newspaper Heute, Wallentin filed a trademark for the brand; it was later suspected that Dichand was covertly funneling funds for this new venture via a shell company owned by his wife.

In 2012, Wallentin gained notoriety as a lawyer and defence counsel for Helmut Elsner, former director of the bank BAWAG P.S.K., in a case which resulted in the Austrian Trade Union Federation owing two billion euro in damages. Wallentin made various television appearances during the course of proceedings, including on ZIB 2 with Armin Wolf, where he made headlines for his blunt attempts to dodge questions.

Wallentin began working as a journalist in 2004, writing reviews for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung under a pseudonym. Between 2013 and 2022, he wrote the full-page weekly column "Frankly said" in the Krone bunt, the Sunday edition of the Kronen Zeitung.

During the 2017 coalition formation between the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), the two parties signed a confidential supplementary paper detailing planned division of personnel in the government. Wallentin was proposed as a member of the Constitutional Court. However, Michael Rami was appointed instead. Reports of the paper only surfaced in January 2022, after the government had left office.

==Politics==

On 11 August 2022, Wallentin announced his candidacy for the 2022 Austrian presidential election. He was endorsed by billionaire and former politician Frank Stronach. On 21 August, Wallentin placed a full-page advertisement for his candidacy in the Krone bunt, the Sunday edition of the Kronen Zeitung. On the reverse side of the page was a signature form which could be cut out and filled in; the advertisement was composed to ensure the back of the form would be blank. Wallentin had researched and concluded that there was no regulation of paper thickness for signature forms, meaning that the newspaper cutout was legally valid for the signature-collecting process. On 24 August, he announced that he had received the 6,000 signatures needed to qualify for the election. By 29 August, he had received 18,000 signatures.

Wallentin portrayed himself as an anti-establishment candidate. Commentators suggested he drew from the FPÖ's electorate, as well as older voters and ÖVP supporters. Prior to the campaign, there was media speculation that he could be nominated as the FPÖ's presidential candidate.

Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Falter published screenshots of sexist content from Wallentin's Instagram account, which he had deactivated shortly before. One featured a nude photo of John Lennon and Yoko Ono with the caption "If you ever feel useless, remember that Yoko Ono destroyed the Beatles with an ass like this", and another image was captioned "It might be International Women's Day, but dinner won't be ready by itself." Another was a photo of an overweight woman wearing a shirt with the phrase "Don't grab me by the pussy", captioned "Leftists worry about things that will never happen." Wallentin responded that the account was satirical in nature, and that it would be "absurd" to accuse him of misogyny since the content targeted both men and women. He said that some of the content was posted by others, and argued that a few posts had been cherrypicked out of dozens as part of a mud-slinging campaign against him.

Wallentin was a guest in ZIB 2 on 19 September, where host Armin Wolf confronted him over numerous false claims made in his columns in the Kronen Zeitung. For example, he had incorrectly claimed that asylum seekers received social security. Wolf also challenged Wallentin's assertion that, due to immigration, Muslims would make up "30 to 40 percent" of Austria's population in twenty years. Previously, in 2017, Vice published an article debunking false claims in Wallentin's articles.

Wallentin won 327,214 votes in the election, a total of 8.07%, placing fourth.

[[1972 ambush of Juan Ponce Enrile]]

The alleged September 22, 1972, ambush attack on the then-Defense Minister of the Philippines Juan Ponce Enrile is a disputed incident in which Enrile's white Mercedes-Benz sedan was ambushed near the upscale Wack Wack village in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila. It was cited by President Ferdinand Marcos as the proximate incident which led to the announcement of Marcos' declaration of martial law the following day, although Marcos would later claim that he signed the formal proclamation of martial law on September 21, the day before the Enrile ambush.

==Background==

By September 1972, Ferdinand Marcos was on the third year of his second term as President of the Philippines, which would have been his last allowed term under the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines, and there was a public perception that Marcos would attempt to find a way to extend his term, either through influencing the outcome of the Philippine Constitutional Convention of 1971, or through a declaration of martial law.

In December 1969, Marcos asked cabinet members to explore his martial law options at least twice: when he tasked Executive Secretary Alejandro Melchor to prepare a study on the potential impacts of such a declaration, and when he asked then-Justice Secretary Enrile to study what powers the 1935 Constitution would grant the President upon the declaration of martial law. Enrile submitted his report within a month of Marcos' 1970 reelection, and Marcos then ordered Enrile to prepare the needed documents for implementing martial law in the Philippines. Two years later, in February 1972, Enrile was moved from the Justice portfolio and appointed as Marcos' Secretary of Defense.

Meanwhile, Marcos' second term was beset with social unrest which had begun with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis attributed to massive debt-driven spending linked to Marcos' 1969 reelection campaign. Protests erupted in January 1970, within a month of his second inauguration on December 30, 1969—a period popularly referred to as the First Quarter Storm. Later incidents include the Diliman Commune uprising of February 1971, the Plaza Miranda bombing of August 1971, and a series of minor but persistent bombings throughout the Philippines' Capital Region in 1972. Government forces were suspected of involvement in both the Plaza Miranda bombing and the Metro manila bombings, although the recently re-established Communist Party of the Philippines was also suspected of culpability.

By 1972, Marcos had issued orders for the Philippine military to prepare for the implementation of martial law, distributing his plans to twelve key Generals and naming each copy after a sign of the Zodiac. National Intelligence Coordinating Agency chief Marcos Soliman received a copy marked "Oplan Sagittarius," which was leaked to the senate and became the focus of a senate investigation. Once martial law had been out in place, Soliman was reported to have died of an alleged heart attack.

==Accounts of alleged ambush==

On the evening of September 22, 1972, news reports were full of accounts that the car of Defense Minister Enrile had been attacked near the upscale Wack Wack subdivision in Mandaluyong. Witnesses had reported hearing gunshots, and then seeing a bullet riddled car on the road after the sound of gunfire had ceased. Further reports during that evening no longer came out, because martial law was implemented in the minutes leading up to midnight. Various conflicting accounts of that eventing's events have surfaced over the years, including a diary recollection by Ferdinand Marcos, a witness account by Wack Wack resident Oscar Lopez, and two conflicting accounts by Enrile himself.

===Marcos diary account===

In an account Marcos recorded in his diary, he said that Enrile had been ambushed near Wack Wack at 8 P.M that evening, but that Enrile had not been in the car that was attacked because he rode a different car as a security measure. The car Enrile was supposed to be in had been riddled by bullets from a parked car nearby.

This version of events remained the official account throughout the 14-year Marcos dictatorship, which included nine years under martial law and a five-year period in which Marcos had officially "lifted" martial law but retained most of his authoritarian powers. While doubts regarding the Enrile ambush existed during this period, they could not be explored fully until February 1986, when Marcos was ousted by the People Power Revolution.

===Primitivo Mijares account===

Marcos aide-turned-whistleblower Primitivo Mijares wrote in 1976 that on the night of the incident, Marcos told Enrile on the phone, "Make it look good. Kailangan siguro ay may masaktan o kung mayroon mapatay ay mas mabuti. it would be better if someone got hurt or killed. O, hala, sige, Johnny, and be sure the story catches the Big News or Newswatch and call me as soon as it is over."

===1986 Enrile account and Post-EDSA media interviews===

In the immediate aftermath of the 1986 EDSA People Power revolution, one of the questions journalists first asked Enrile was the matter of whether the 1972 ambush had in fact been true, or whether it had been faked. In interviews with local broadsheet the Philippine Daily Inquirer and Australian publication The Age, Enrile stated that the ambush had been faked, with The Age reporting that "Mr Enrile told a media conference at Camp Crame that an alleged attempted assassination of himself 14 years ago—one of the factors which led to the imposition of martial law—was staged." This assertion was later cited by other journalists, including Time correspondent Sandra Burton and Philippine Graphic editor and later National Artist Nick Joaquin.

Enrile also separately admitted to journalist Katherine Ellison and to New York Times reporter Raymond Bonner that the ambush had been a fake. Bonner corroborated his account through other sources, noting that "Several American intelligence officers told me that the car attack was phony. 'Flimflam.'" Enrile's wife Cristina likewise told Bonner that "God had had nothing to do" with saving Enrile from the ambush, because in fact "Marcos and Enrile had staged the 'ambush,' as the final justification for martial law."

===Oscar Lopez account===

One of the few well-documented firsthand accounts of the event was that of Oscar M. Lopez of the Lopez Holdings Corporation, who had lived in Wack Wack near the site of the alleged ambush at the time. Recounting the events off September 22, 1972, in his book Phoenix: The Saga of the Lopez Family, he recounts: "After the shooting died down, I went out. I took a peek at what was happening outside my fence, and I saw this car riddled with bullets. Nobody was hurt; there was no blood. The car was empty." Lopez added that he knew from what he saw that whatever had happened to the car, "it had been no ambush."

Lopez later said that their driver had seen the incident itself:

===Fidel V. Ramos account===

Some years after his presidency, former president Fidel V. Ramos also said in a 2012 book that "Enrile himself admitted that his reported ambush was a 'fake' and that his unoccupied car had been riddled with machine gun bullets fired by his own men on the night Proclamation 1081 was signed."

==2012 Enrile denial==

In 2012, however, Enrile began to deny that the 1972 had been ambushed, claiming in his book Juan Ponce Enrile: A Memoir that his political opponents had been the ones to spread the account that the 1972 ambush was staged as a justification for martial law. Enrile repeated this denial several times after that, leading up to the election of Marcos's son Bongbong Marcos as President of the Philippines.

==Pretext for the declaration of martial law==

While not mentioned in the already prepared documents proclaiming martial law in the Philippines, Marcos cited the Enrile ambush as a rationalization for the proclamation in his diary, which historians agree to have been written for purposes of release to the public. In his entry for September 1972, Marcos wrote that Enrile had been ambushed near Wack-Wack that night. He wrote that "it was a good thing he was riding in his security car as a protective measure... This makes the martial law proclamation a necessity."

The implementation of martial law began sometime before midnight on September 22, with the arrest of the two main opposition leaders, Ninoy Aquino, who on September 21 held a Congress speech to denounce impending martial law, and Jose W. Diokno, who held a rally with 50,000 people from the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties (MCCCL) at Plaza Miranda on the same day. By dawn of the following day, many of the 400 individuals listed on the military's priority arrest list—journalists, members of the political opposition, constitutional convention delegates, outspoken lawyers, teachers, and students—had been detained.

Media outlets were shuttered, although those linked with Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto were allowed to reopen within the day. Soon after, Congress was abolished, mass activities were prohibited, political parties were outlawed, a curfew was put in place, and civil and political rights were suspended.

Martial law immediately shut down 7 television stations, 16 national daily newspapers, 11 weekly magazines, 66 community newspapers, and 292 radio stations; as well as public utilities such as Meralco, PLDT, and the three then-existing Philippine airlines.

Marcos' 14 years as dictator is historically remembered for its record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. Based on the documentation of Amnesty International, Task Force Detainees of the Philippines, and similar human rights monitoring entities, historians believe that the Marcos dictatorship was marked by 3,257 known extrajudicial killings, 35,000 documented tortures, 77 forced disappearances, and 70,000 incarcerations.

Some 2,520 of the 3,257 murder victims were tortured and mutilated before their bodies were dumped in various places for the public to discover—a tactic meant to sow fear among the public, which came to be known as "salvaging." Some bodies were even cannibalized.

==Aftermath==

As a key player in the planning and implementation of martial law, Enrile remained one of Marcos' most loyal allies in the dictatorship's early years. In 1973, Enrile's title became Defense Minister under the new modified parliamentary system put in place during martial law. The abolition of civilian institutions such as Congress, the weakening of the judiciary, and the outlawing of political parties, left the military as the only other instrumentality of the national government outside of the Presidency.

The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) notes that Enrile, as one of Marcos' cronies, was controversially appointed to highly profitable positions during this time. According to the NCHP, he was tasked by Marcos to give certificates to logging companies, which eventually led to the forest cover of the Philippines shrank until only 8% remained, while Enrile concurrently owned numerous logging companies such as Ameco in Bukidnon, Dolores Timber in Samar, San Jose Timber in Northern Samar, Kasilagan Softwood Development Corp in Butuan, Eurasia Match in Cebu, Pan Oriental which operates in Cebu and Butuan, Palawan-Apitong Corp in Palawan, and Royal Match.

The NHCP also recounts that Enrile was appointed by Marcos as the President of the Philippine Coconut Authority, where he established control of the copra industry together with Danding Cojuangco. The fund, which was supposed to be used to improve the country's copra industry, was used by Enrile and Cojuangco for programs led by Imelda Marcos and other Marcos cronies. A large portion of the fund was also used for the presidential campaigns of Ferdinand Marcos in 1983.

With rising factionalism in the Marcos administration towards its latter years, Enrile's influence began to be reduced. By the 1980s, Marcos clipped the powers of the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of Staff over the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and began to more aggressively bypass Enrile's authority.

In February 1986, Enrile turned his back on Marcos and co-organized a failed coup against the administration. Enrile asked Catholic Cardinal Archbishop Jaime Sin for assistance. Sin called on the civil groups which were already organizing protests in light of alleged cheating in the 1986 presidential election, and the large turnout of peaceful protesters led to Marcos being unable to attack the coup plotters, and eventually forced Marcos out of office and into exile.

[[Premier Manager 2000]]

CATEGORIES: 2000 video games, Europe-exclusive video games, PlayStation (console) games, Premier Manager, Association football management video games, Video games developed in the United Kingdom, Infogrames games

Premier Manager 2000 is a soccer management simulation game, for PlayStation. It was released only in Europe in 2000 and was developed by Infogrames Sheffield House and published by Infogrames. It is part of the Premier Manager series.

==Gameplay==

Premier Manager 2000 is a football management simulation game that puts the player in charge of a team of their choice from the top four English divisions (Premier League to the third division, as it was known at the time) or the top two Italian, German, French and Spanish leagues. The player must manage the team's tactics, formations and training. The player must also manage the financial side of running a football club including choosing the team sponsors, upgrading or building new stadia and undertaking wage negotiations with players. The game features brief pre-rendered 3D animations which trigger during certain in-game events such as players retiring or the construction of new stadia.

Match highlights are presented in full 3D, with commentary provided by Barry Davies. Alternatively, players can choose to watch a simple text commentary describing the action. 

The game supports use of the PlayStation Mouse and up to four players using the Multitap accessory.

==Development==

Following the acquisition of Gremlin Interactive by Infogrames in 1999, development of the series shifted in-house to Infogrames Sheffield House from Madrid-based company Dinamic Multimedia, who had developed the Premier Manager series since its '97 release. The 3D highlights provided in-game utilise Gremlin's Actua Soccer 3 engine.

==Reception==

The title received mixed reviews, with critics praising its simple user interface and 'pick up and play' gameplay, but with others arguing that the gameplay was little changed from the previous game in the series (Premier Manager: Ninety Nine) and pointing to the relative strength of competitors on the console such as LMA Manager.

CVG's Maura Sutton wrote that the game "rapidly dissolves into a tedious mixture of text and repetitive churning through various screens" and criticised the "clunky and awkward" control system, awarding a score of just 2/5. Total Station's Lee Barrass praised the game's "friendly interface and a wealth of statistics that would keep even the hardest of anoraks happy", but argued that "for sheer gameplay...you may have to look elsewhere in an overcrowded market" of football management games on the console. Writing in Extreme PlayStation magazine Kendall Lacey gave a score of 85%, describing it as an "interesting and fulfilling challenge" for players who were willing to "put in some serious hours" and wrestle with the full depth of the game's options. Official PlayStation Magazine gave the game a score of 6/10, commenting that "despite its face-lift to Premier Manager: Ninety Nine it remains old skool" and "not smart enough to tackle LMA Manager". However, the same magazine would later place the title at number 24 in its list of the "Best Sports Games Ever" on the PlayStation console.

[[William (1797 ship)]]

CATEGORIES: 1788 ships, Captured ships, Age of Sail merchant ships of England, Liverpool slave ships

William was launched in Spain in 1788, almost certainly under another name. She was taken in prize in 1797. William sailed as a West Indiaman until 1800 when new owners started to sail her as a slave ship in the triangular trade in enslaved people. She made four complete voyages as a slave ship. A report of her fourth voyage provides insight into the decision making over the planning of the voyage. Spanish privateers captured her in 1805 on her fifth slave voyage.

==Career==

William first appeared in Lloyd's Register in 1797.

Captain Joseph Bland acquired a letter of marque on 9 November 1798.

1st voyage transporting enslaved people (1800–1801): Captain Francis Stowell acquired a letter of marque on 14 June 1800. He sailed from Liverpool on 23 July. In 1800, 133 vessels sailed from British ports on voyages to transport enslaved people; 120 of these vessels sailed from Liverpool.

William acquired captives at New Calabar. She arrived at Suriname on 226 December with 200 captives. She left Suriname on 19 February 1801 and arrived back at Liverpool on 20 April. She had left Liverpool with 27 crew members and suffered 10 crew deaths on her voyage.

2nd voyage transporting enslaved people (1801–1802): Captain Stowell sailed from Liverpool on 24 June 1801. In 1801, 147 vessels sailed from British ports on voyages to transport enslaved people; 122 of these vessels sailed from Liverpool.

William acquired captives at New Calabar and stopped at São Tomé on he way from Africa to the West Indies. William arrived at Suriname on 25 December. She sailed from Suriname on 24 April 1802 and arrived back at Liverpool on 11 June 1802. She had left Liverpool with 27 crew members and had suffered seven crew deaths on her voyage.

3rd voyage transporting enslaved people (1802–1803): Captain Joseph Haile left Liverpool on 8 September 1802, during the Peace of Amiens so he did not acquire a letter of marque. In 1802, 155 vessels sailed from British ports on voyages to transport enslaved people; 122 of these vessels sailed from Liverpool.

William arrived at Trinidad on 9 April 1803 with 198 captives. She arrived back at Liverpool on 24 August 1803. She had left Liverpool with 25 crew members and had suffered 12 crew deaths on her voyage.

In early I804, John Leigh and Captain John Ainsworth decided that New Calabar offered the possibility of a better than 100% profit to their partnership.

4th voyage transporting enslaved people (1804–1805): Captain John Ainsworth acquired a letter of marque on 5 June 1804. He sailed from Liverpool on 28 June, to acquire captives at Bonny and New Calabar. In 1804, 147 vessels sailed from British ports on voyages to transport enslaved people; 126 of these vessels sailed from Liverpool.

Leigh and Ainsworth's plan was that William would arrive in New Calabar after the July–August yam harvest. In addition to captives, Ainsworth could acquire yams to feed the captives during the Middle Passage. If she left the Bight of Biafra by October or November she would arrive in the West Indies in time to sell the captives during the beginning of the sugar harvest.

In late November 1804, William was off the Guianas when a French privateer attacked her. Although William was able to repel the attack, she was badly damaged.

William arrived at Suriname on 1 December with 196 slaves. There the factors forced Ainsworth "to sell his Slaves at best price." Because of the damage to William, Ainsworth could not sail to another market in the West Indies.

William sailed from Suriname on 29 January 1805 and arrived back at Liverpool on 27 March. She had left Liverpool with 31 crew members and had suffered six crew deaths on her voyage. On her return, Leigh stated that "altho this Vessel looked so very favorable at one time we fear not much profit will arise."

5th enslaving voyage (1805–loss): Captain David Christie acquired a letter of marque on 5 June 1805. He sailed from Liverpool on 28 June. He started to acquire captives at Malembo.

==Fate==

In December 1805, Lloyd's List reported that William, Christie, master, , Mills, master, and , Grice, master, had been captured at Angola on 1 September. They were among the seven vessels off the Congo River that had fallen prey to a privateer. The privateer was described as being of 22 guns and 350 men. William's captor sent her to the River Plate.

A second report named the captors as L'Orient, of 14 guns, and Dromedario, of 22 guns. The captured vessels arrived in the River Plate before 12 November. William arrived at Montevideo with only two enslaved people.

Spanish records report that in June 1805, Viceroy Sobremonte, of Argentina, issued two letters of marque, one for Dolores (24 guns), Currand, master, and Berro y Errasquin, owner, and one for Dromedario (20 guns), Hippolito Mordel, master, and Canuerso y Masini, owner. The two sailed for the African coast, looking to capture enslaving ships. In three months of cruising Dolores captured three ships and one brig, carrying a total 600 enslaved people. Dromedario captured five ships, carrying a total of 500 enslaved people.

In 1805, 30 British enslaving ships were lost. Thirteen were lost on the coast of Africa. During the period 1793 to 1807, war, rather than maritime hazards or slave resistance, was the greatest cause of vessel losses among British slave vessels.

Ah-ri is also in contact with a mysterious user, bbbfamous, who claims to be helping Ah-ri plot the downfall of the Gabin influencers, but who also has a darker alternative. During her rise and eventual fall, Ah-ri exposes the scandalous lives of the influencers, involving scams, drugs, and eventually death.

Han Jun-kyung (Kang Min-hyuk), a wealthy and well-sought after bachelor, is immediately attracted to Ah-ri when he first sees her and takes every opportunity to be with her. He eventually forms a romantic relationship with Ah-ri and uses his social status to help her.

Jin Tae-jeon (Lee Dong-gun), the CEO of the biggest law firm Taegang, despises Jun-kyung and goes to great lengths to destroy Ah-ri while hiding a dark secret of his own.

Gabin Society: The influencers' content house whose members derive their sense of self-importance from their hierarchy of followers on Instagram. The members desire the fame of being the most followed on social media, but do not bear any responsibility for how they achieve this fame. Each of them would go to extreme lengths to protect their reputation and status, even if that means throwing the others under the bus. The influencers are corrupted by vanity and jealousy, and others are ready to take them down.

1. Oh Min-hye (Jun Hyo-seong): She is jealous of Ah-ri. She claims to come from a wealthy family but does not. She attaches significant importance to designer bags and runs her own shopping mall. She is married to a man who she constantly insults and berates, however he enjoys the luxurious lifestyle that comes from being married to her. She also gets some followers and fame by depicting her relationship with her husband on social media as ideal and perfect. She and her husband run a Ponzi scheme to fund their lavish lifestyle.

2. Yoon Si-hyeon (Lee Chung-ah): She is the "big sister" of the Gabin Society and is not on any social media. She is kind-hearted, and has a soft spot for Ah-ri. She is married to Tae-jeon, and was previously engaged to Jun-kyung.

3. Jin Chae-hee (Han Jae-in): She comes from a wealthy family. She relies on her family status to leverage her social media presence and to get collaborations from brands. She is the sister of Tae-jeon. She abusively uses drugs.

4. Angela (Han Eu-ddeum): She married a rich husband but does not allow her to spend his money lavishly. Therefore, she resorts to soliciting her body for the money.

5. Ji-na (Kim Si-hyun): She sells knock-off copies of designer brands and claims them to be real to her followers. She also flaunts these fake brands to claim that she comes from old money.

6. Han Yu-rang (Jung Yoo-min): She is Min-hye's lackey and married to plastic surgeon, Kim Min-chan, who engages in malpractice. Her relationship with her husband is very contested.

Oleksiy Valeriyovych Zhuravko (Олексій Валерійович Журавко, Алексей Валерьевич Журавко; 21 April 1974 – 25 September 2022) was a Ukrainian and Russian politician who was a member of Ukraine's national parliament Verkhovna Rada from 2006 to 2012. He was a member of the pro-Russian Party of Regions from 2006. Zhuravko moved to Russia in 2015. He acquired Russian citizenship and joined the United Russia party in July 2022. He died in September 2022 in a missile attack in Kherson during the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive.

==Early life and education==

Born on 21 April 1974 in Zhovti Vody, Zhuravko lived in an orphanage from 1974 to 1978. In 1978, he moved to a boarding school in Tsiurupynsk where he lived until 1990. From 1990 until his return to Tsiurupynsk in 1993, Zhuravko had his vocational education in a boarding school in Luhansk.

Beginning in 1997, Zhuravko started several companies aimed at the disabled in Ukraine in Tsiurupynsk. In 2007, Zhuravko completed his education at the Kherson State University, majoring in economic theory. The same year, Zhuravko and his wife, Anzhela (born 1986), had a daughter.

==Political career==

Zhuravko failed to be elected in the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election as a candidate of For United Ukraine! in Kherson Oblast's electoral district 183.

In 2004, Zhuravko became chairman or the Union of Public Organizations "Confederation of Public Organizations of Disabled People of Ukraine." Zhuravko was awarded the Ukrainian Order of Merit twice. Third Class in 2000 and Second Class in 2004. In the 2006 and 2007 parliamentary election Zhuravko was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's national parliament) for the Party of Regions. In 2006, he was placed 118th on the party list, and the following year he dropped 22 places.

In the 2012 parliamentary election, Zhuravko again failed to be elected; this time as a Party of Regions candidate in electoral district 186 (also located in Kherson Oblast). On 17 April 2013, Zhuravko was appointed Government Commissioner for the Rights of the Disabled. This position was abolished on 5 March 2014.

Zhuravko moved to Russia in 2015. On 21 February 2015, he attended an anti-Euromaidan rally/commemoration in Moscow. In October 2015, Zhuravko was reportedly "hiding from Ukrainian authorities" and openly supporting separatism. In December 2015, Zhuravko's title of honorary citizen of Tsiurupynsk was removed. In January 2018, a pre-trial investigation was started into his alleged financing of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic quasi-states proclaimed within the territory of Ukraine.

Zhuravko acquired Russian citizenship and joined the United Russia party in July 2022. Following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, he returned to Russian occupied Kherson in late April 2022. On 22 September 2022, Zhuravko published a video in which he cast his vote in Kherson at the 2022 annexation referendums. He stated that the Kherson Oblast's (Russian) occupation was the region's "liberation from Ukrainian nationalists." Zhuravko called on Russia "to complete the special operation and reach the western borders of Ukraine in order to liberate the country from the nationalists." He became wanted by the Security Service of Ukraine and was suspected of actions "aimed at violently changing or overthrowing the constitutional order or seizing state power". Zhuravko was killed on 25 September 2022, during the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive, in a missile strike on Kherson which pro-Kremlin authorities blamed on Ukraine.

[[Ytterbium compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Ytterbium compounds, Ytterbium, Chemical compounds by element

Ytterbium compounds are chemical compounds that contain the element ytterbium (Yb). The chemical behavior of ytterbium is similar to that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).

==Halides==

Ytterbium forms both dihalides and trihalides with the halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The dihalides are susceptible to oxidation to the trihalides at room temperature and disproportionate to the trihalides and metallic ytterbium at high temperature:

Some ytterbium halides are used as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid and can be used as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF3) is used as an inert and non-toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which are good for dental health, and is also a good X-ray contrast agent.

==Oxides==

Ytterbium reacts with oxygen to form ytterbium(III) oxide (Yb2O3), which crystallizes in the "rare-earth C-type sesquioxide" structure which is related to the fluorite structure with one quarter of the anions removed, leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate (non-octahedral) environments. Ytterbium(III) oxide can be reduced to ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) with elemental ytterbium, which crystallizes in the same structure as sodium chloride.

==Borides==

Ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB12) is a crystalline material that has been studied to understand various electronic and structural properties of many chemically related substances. It is a Kondo insulator. It is a quantum material; under normal conditions, the interior of the bulk crystal is an insulator whereas the surface is highly conductive. Among the rare earth elements, ytterbium is one of the few that can form a stable dodecaboride, a property attributed to its comparatively small atomic radius.

==Other inorganic compounds==

Ytterbium(III) nitrate is the nitrate of ytterbium in the +3 oxidation state. The compound forms colorless crystals, dissolves in water, and also forms crystalline hydrates. It can be obtained by reacting ytterbium and nitric oxide in ethyl acetate:

Ytterbium phosphide is the phosphide of ytterbium in the +3 oxidation state. It can be obtained by reacting ytterbium and phosphine in liquid ammonia to form Yb(PH2)2·5NH3, which can be decomposed to obtain ytterbium phosphide:

The compound forms black crystals of a cubic system, space group Fm3m.

Ytterbium(III) acetate is an the acetate of ytterbium in the +3 oxidation state. It has colorless crystals that are soluble in water and can form hydrates. Ytterbium acetate can be used as a raw material for the synthesis of upconversion luminescent materials；it can also be used as a catalyst for some specific organic reactions.

==Alloys==

===Ytterbium dirhodium disilicide===

Ytterbium dirhodium disilicide (YbRh2Si2), also abbreviated YRS, is a heavy fermion solid state compound of ytterbium, rhodium and silicon. It becomes superconducting when cooled to 2 mK. Just above this temperature the heat capacity is extremely high, and the electrons behave as if they were 1,000,000 times heavier than they really are.

===Ytterbium-bismuth-platinum===

Ytterbium-bismuth-platinum is an intermetallic material which at low temperatures exhibits an extremely high value of specific heat, which is a characteristic of heavy-fermion behavior. 

Ytterbium-bismuth-platinum has a noncentrosymmetric cubic crystal structure; in particular it belongs to the ternary half-Heusler compounds.

===Ytterbium-gallium-germanium===

Ytterbium-gallium-germanium (also called YbGaGe) is an alloy of ytterbium, gallium and germanium. It sparked interest because one group of researchers reported that it exhibits zero thermal expansion, while being conductive. Such materials have applications in space and other environments where low thermal expansion materials are required. However, subsequent measurements by other groups were not able to reproduce those results, but rather found expansion coefficients similar to copper.

[[Lutetium compounds]]

CATEGORIES: Lutetium, Lutetium compounds, Chemical compounds by element

Lutetium compounds are compounds formed by the lanthanide metal lutetium (Lu). In these compounds, lutetium generally exhibits the +3 oxidation state, such as LuCl3, Lu2O3 and Lu2(SO4)3. Aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying, with the common exception of the iodide. The soluble salts, such as nitrate, sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization. The oxide, hydroxide, fluoride, carbonate, phosphate and oxalate are insoluble in water.

==Oxides==

Lutetium(III) oxide is a white solid, a cubic compound of lutetium which sometimes used in the preparation of specialty glasses. It is also called lutecia. It is a lanthanide oxide, also known as a rare earth. Lutetium(III) oxide is an important raw material for laser crystals. It also has specialized uses in ceramics, glass, phosphors, and lasers. Lutetium(III) oxide is used as a catalyst in cracking, alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization. The band gap of lutetium oxide is 5.5 eV.

==Halides==

Lutetium(III) fluoride can be produced by reacting lutetium oxide with hydrogen fluoride, or reacting lutetium chloride and hydrofluoric acid. It can also be produced by reacting lutetium sulfide and hydrofluoric acid:

Lutetium oxide and nitrogen trifluoride react at 240 °C to produce LuOF. A second step happens below 460 °C to produce LuF3. Lutetium(III) chloride forms hygroscopic white monoclinic crystals and also a hydroscopic hexahydrate LuCl3·6H2O. Anhydrous lutetium(III) chloride has the YCl3 (AlCl3) layer structure with octahedral lutetium ions. Lutetium(III) bromide can be synthesized through the following reaction:

If burned, lutetium(III) bromide may produce hydrogen bromide and metal oxide fumes. Lutetium(III) bromide reacts to strong oxidizing agents. Lutetium(III) iodide can be obtained by reacting lutetium with iodine:

Lutetium(III) iodide can also obtained by the reacting metallic lutetium with mercury iodide in  vacuum at 500 °C:

The elemental mercury generated in the reaction can be removed by distillation. The lutetium(III) iodide hydrate crystallized from the solution can be heated with ammonium iodide to obtain the anhydrate.

==Coordination compounds==

===Nitrogen-containing ligand complexes===

====Lutetium phtalocyanine====

Lutetium phthalocyanine is the most notable coordination compound of lutetium, and is derived from lutetium and two phthalocyanines. It was the first known example of a molecule that is an intrinsic semiconductor. It exhibits electrochromism, changing color when subject to a voltage. It is a double-decker sandwich compound consisting of a Lu(3+) ion coordinated to two the conjugate base of two phthalocyanines.  The rings are arranged in a staggered conformation. The extremities of the two ligands are slightly distorted outwards. The complex features a non-innocent ligand, in the sense that the macrocycles carry an extra electron. It is a free radical with the unpaired electron sitting in a half-filled molecular orbital between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbitals, allowing its electronic properties to be finely tuned. It, along with many substituted derivatives like the alkoxy-methyl derivative Lu(C8H17OCH2)8Pc2, can be deposited as a thin film with intrinsic semiconductor properties; said properties arise due to its radical nature and its low reduction potential compared to other metal phthalocyanines. This initially green film exhibits electrochromism; the oxidized form Lu is red, whereas the reduced form Lu is blue and the next two reduced forms are dark blue and violet, respectively. The green/red oxidation cycle can be repeated over 10,000 times in aqueous solution with dissolved alkali metal halides, before it is degraded by hydroxide ions; the green/blue redox degrades faster in water.

====Other complexes====

LuI2(HOiPr)4I can be dissolved in pyridine-THF to give yellow LuI(OiPr)(py)5I. LuI3 is directly dissolved in pyridine-THF to obtain yellow LuI2(py)5I. In both compounds pyridine is coordinated to lutetium by nitrogen atom. Lutetium(III) nitrate can be crystallized with 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine (terpy) in dry acetonitrile to obtain colorless Lu(terpy)(NO3)3, in which the nitrogen atom and the oxygen atom of the nitrate are coordinated to the lutetium atom.

===Oxygen-containing ligand complexes===

Trivalent lutetium and water can form complex ions such as Lu(OH2)n3+, and lutetium(III) perchlorate and lutetium(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate can exist in the form of hydrates. Ether (R2O) is also a common oxygen-containing ligand. For example, Lu(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 can be obtained by reacting lutetium(III) chloride and (trimethylsilyl)methyllithium in a solvent containing tetrahydrofuran (THF).

==Other compounds==

Adding ammonia water or a hydroxide to the aqueous solution of any soluble lutetium salt can precipitate lutetium(III) hydroxide (Lu(OH)3). The hexagonal lutetium hydroxide can be heated and dehydrated to obtain the monoclinic lutetium oxyhydroxide (LuO(OH)), and further heating will make it decompose into lutetium(III) oxide (Lu2O3). Lutetium oxyhalides (LuOX, X=Cl, Br, I) can be obtained by hydrolysis of the lutetium trihalides. Lu2Cl2C can be obtained by reacting lutetium(III) chloride, caesium chloride, lutetium and carbon at a high temperature.

Inge Marie Eriksen (22 October 1935 – 13 March 2015) was a Danish writer and political activist. She became involved in Danish public debate in the 1960s and helped to the left-wing Left Socialists political party establish that she left in 1969. Eriksen began her writing career in 1975 and won various awards for her work from her first book that was published in 1975 and her final one in 2009. Her works include novels such as the science fiction series Rummet uden tid, 1–4 and Sommerfugelens vinge.

==Early life and education==

Eriksen was born in Skørping, Denmark on 22 October 1935. She was the daughter of the Norwegian railway official Erik Eriksen and the nurse Nanna Henriette Jungersen. Eriksen spent her early childhood in Southern Jutland, before she, her brother and mother relocated to Ålborg upon the death of her father in a German concentration camp in 1945. In 1957, she became a student of Aalborg City Gymnasium and then read comparative literature at Aarhus University until 1962 when she moved to Copenhagen. Eriksen became a teacher in the Gladsakse primary school from 1973 to 1975 after earning a degree at Copenhagen Day and Evening Seminary until she became a full-time writer. She had also worked at a newspaper employee and in a hotel, organic farming, antique shop, dairy and at a city nursery.

==Career==

She became involved in public debate in the 1960s. Eriksen helped to establish the left-wing Left Socialists political party in 1967 and became a member of its primary board in mid-1968 before being employed in its office that same year. In 1969, she resigned from the party, due to the Leninist influence in the party and ceased left-wing political activism in 1972. Eriksen's first book, the gender-political work Kællinger i Danmark, co-written with the film director and painter Jytte Rex was published in 1975 after the two held the Drømmen og den rasende latte exhibition the previous year. The following year, she authored the two-volume novel Victoria og verdensrevolutionen. This was followed by Eriksen's next novel  Fugletræet about the contemporary division of love and work in 1979, and made her debut as a playwright with the futuristic horror Vinden er ikke til salg a year later.

In 1981, she published the historical novel Silkehavet about the bourgeois revolution. Eriksen wrote the science fiction series Rummet uden tid, 1–4 that includes the books Luderen fra Gomorra (1983), Nord for tiden in 1985, Dinosaurernes morgen in 1986 and Paradismaskinen in 1989, which were published between 1983 and 1989. In 1992, she wrote the social novel Hjertets fifth kammer, and Hertuginden three years later; both novels were focused on people who lived through the Second World War and hoping to continue her livelihoods. Eriksen went on to author the novel series Sommerfugelens vinge from 1997 to 2001 that provided a contemporary historical analysis of the social development of the people of Europe at the conclusion of the 1990s. These books were Tørvegraverne in 1997, De rumænske bøfler in 1999 and Vinterhaven in 2001. She went on to publish the political-psychological novel realism novel Citrontræet in 2003, the social realism novel En kvinde med hat in 2005, and Blues for en lyserød sko  in 2007. Eriksen wrote her memoirs Brød og roser in 2009, and she also worked as a freelance writer and magazine editor. She was a member of the Social Democrats from the late 1980s, and died in Aalborg, Denmark on 13 March 2015.

==Awards==

Eriksen was the recipient of several literature awards. In 1976, she was awarded the Otto Benzons Prize, the SFC Prize in 1986, the Adam Oehlenschläger-Legatet in 1987, the Georg Brandes Award in 1994, HK's Kunstnerpris in 1996, the Martin Andersen Nexø Prize in 1999 and the Otto Gelsted Prize in 2001.

[[Society.Future]]

CATEGORIES: Opposition to Vladimir Putin, Russian nationalist organizations, Political parties established in 2020

Society.Future (Obshchestvo.Budushcheye ; OB) is a Russian national-democratic political movement founded by public figure Roman Yuneman on 11 November 2020. According to Yuneman, the Society.Future movement positions itself as center-right and will try to occupy the niche of constructive opposition.

Yuneman's followers are in favor of "Russian" Russia, economic and constitutional reforms, as well as the abolition of the use of electronic voting.

The Society.Future defines itself as a "third force": it is in opposition to the current government, but does not agree with the majority of opposition leaders on a number of fundamental ideological issues, including the dispute over the ownership of Crimea

==History==

In January 2020, Roman Yuneman established an analytical center for the preparation of projects for socio-political reforms "Society.Future". On 24 June 2020, at the presentation of his own version of the Constitution of Russia from Society.Future, Roman Yuneman announced the transformation of the thought factory into a political movement.

On 11 November 2020, the participants of the movement, led by Roman Yuneman, gathered at the Grafskaya Pier of Sevastopol to establish the "Society. Future", coinciding with the centenary of the "Russian Exodus".

In 2021, the founder of the movement, Roman Yuneman, became a nominee in the Forbes rating of "30 Most Promising Russians Under 30" in the "Social Practices" category.

Roman Yuneman, the founder of Society.Future, was not allowed to participate in the 2021 Russian legislative election in the Chertanovo constituency. After that, the movement redirected its forces to the New Moscow constituency to support the candidate from the New People party, a member of the Society.Future, Danil Makhnitsky.

In early 2022, the movement was accused of collaborating with the far-right ultra-nationalist book publishing house Black Hundred.

Members of the Society.Future movement, despite their opposition to the authorities, supported the accession of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic to Russia.

The movement participated in the 2022 Moscow municipal elections.

==Ideology==

From the presentation of the movement it followed that the movement stands for the protection of basic human rights and freedoms, the creation of "real democratic institutions" and the free market. At the same time, its founders consider it necessary to “restore the historical continuity” of Russia and change the migration policy, and also emphasize that “Crimea is Russia.” And in the political memorandum of the organization it is said that the most important task of the state should be "protection of Russians and Russian culture" in the broadest sense.

BTOP Hokkaido, formerly known as BTOP Thank Kuriyama, are a Japanese football club based in Kuriyama, Sorachi, Hokkaido. They play in the Hokkaido Soccer League. Despite playing in a league that holds an amateur status, the club's players and employees are currently signed on professional contracts.

==History==

The club was founded in 1998 as Sapporo Thank FC. A phoenix club, the club was formed from the dissolution of another Hokkaido club, Anfini Sapporo. Initially being from Sapporo, the club changed their hometown on 2004, moving to Kuriyama, a town on Hokkaido. After the hometown changed, the club became Thank FC Kuriyama. Until 2006, they played at the Hokkaido Soccer League, but got relegated after finishing on the league's 7th place.

From 2007 to 2021, they played at the Hokkaido Block Leagues, which can be considered Japan's 7th-tier league. At the start of the 2021 year, the club once again rebranded, now changing into BTOP Thank Kuriyama. Former J.League player Tetsuya Yano became the club's president, and the players were all signed into professional contracts.

On 2022, they debuted at one of the Japan's 5th-tier league, at its respective league of the Japanese Regional Leagues (conglomerate of all 9 existent regional leagues that can vary from 5th to 6th-tier, depending on the region), Hokkaido Soccer League. After signing experienced players to help the team, BTOP Thank Kuriyama immediately won the Hokkaido Soccer League title after being promoted, after a last effort was made on 25 September, beating Sapporo FC by 8–0. With this win, their got their first promotion opportunity to the Japan Football League, Japan's 4th division, via the 2022 Regional Champions League. They had qualified to the tournament by winning the Hokkaido League and by finishing as 2022 Shakaijin Cup runners-up., where they lost to Briobecca Urayasu by 5–3 on penalty shoot-outs, after a 0–0 tie in the regulation time.  Despite their efforts, they were eliminated in the group stage of the competition, losing all three matches by 2–1.

The club aspires to be the second team from Hokkaido to ever join the J.League in any of its current divisions, after Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo on 1998. The path to join the J1 League is much more difficult from before, as newly-founded teams have to climb from five or more leagues, to finally earn promotion for the J1 League. BTOP Thank Kuriyama, however, in high hopes, highlights their ambition to join the Japanese maximum level of professional football in back-to-back promotions by 2027.

On 13 March 2023, the club officially announced another name change, becoming BTOP Hokkaido. The club stated that the reasoning behind the change was "...to convey the charm of Hokkaido, which is full of dreams and vitality, through sports. (BTOP) will strive to grow into a team that is loved by everyone by involving the whole of Hokkaido by contributing to a wider range of areas through the team's activities."

Vjekoslav Prebeg is former Croatian and Ukrainian soldier.

==Biography==

Prebeg was born in Zagreb in 1982. According to his sister, ever since he was a kid he wanted to become a soldier. When he was younger, he attempted to join French Foreign Legion, but didn't managed to pass the selection. He spent five years serving in Croatian 1st Mechanized Battalion "Tigers" as a professional soldier, until realising that he will unlikely be promoted. He subsequently left Croatia and joined Ukrainian marines around 2020. In Ukraine he also found a girlfriend Irina, who escaped to France as a refugee when invasion started.

===Siege of Mariupol===

As the invasion started on 24 February, his unit on the frontline only managed to hold initail Russian onslaught for 12 hours, when they were given orders to withdraw. During thair withdrawal, he said that a lack of adequate anti-tank weapons proved to be a major problem. They gradually kept withdrawing, until from early March they ended up surrounded by the Russians in Mariupol kettle.

On 28 February 2022, he announced on his Facebook profile that he will be going offline from social networks to avoid being located by the enemy. As the situation became unbearable, he and group of his fellow soldiers attempted to reach Ukrainian controlled territory across Russian controlled territory. He said: "We left Mariupol and walked and hid for 260 kilometers, while trying to avoid every possible contact. We walked only by night." Their extraction plan failed when his group encountered a Russian artillery unit and decided to surrender.

===Captivity===

After his release, he assessed that regular Russian troops which originally captured his group treated them rather correctly, but the harassment started when they were handed over to DNR militia. Militants posed him questions like: "Why did Croatian Army sent you here? What kind of equipment do you use?" - to which he responded that he is not active member of Croatian Army, but Ukrainian Army and that he doesn't know. Subsequently some Russian major, and general took over the interrogation who were, according to him, convinced that "he was some major spy".  He was subsequenty show-trialed by the DNR along with British nationals John Harding, Andrew Hill, Dylan Healy and a Swede Mathias Gustavsson. They were accused of being "foreign mercenaries" by separatist court. As the trial started Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the statement saying that they: "reject the indictment which they do not consider legal due to not being in accordance with international law and international conventions on how to deal with captured civilians and prisoners of war". After being captured, Prebeg's Facebook profile was used to spread Russian propaganda and was massively spammed by mostly Serb nationals who celebrated his capture by the Russians. Serb journalist Miodrag Zarković, who openly supports Russian aggression on Ukraine was given permission by Russians to interview Prebeg in captivity. After being released from captivity Prebeg sait that right before this interview by the Serbs, he was heavially beaten by the guards. Bosnian fact checking portal Raskrinkavanje.ba wrote that aforementioned interviews served to spread Russian propaganda, and that several regional medias spread disinformation based on these interviews by describing Prebeg as Azov fighter, although he clearly stated that he wasn't. Prebeg later said in an interview to Croatian media that his captors tortured him with electricity, beat him and performed mock executions on him. In his interview in Podcast Inkubator on 13 March 2023, Prebeg said that DNR indictment of him as a "mercenary" lasted until Russians searched his phone found his contract with official Ukrainian institutions.Then he was given a status of witness on the court as Russian Federation officially did not want to participate in this trial. For a while, Prebeg shared a prison cell with a Brit Aiden Aslin who claimed that Prebeg deterred him from suicidal thoughts.

===Release===

Prebeg was released from Russian captivity after mediation of Saudi Arabian prince Mohammed bin Salman, along with dozens of other former Ukrainian international fighters. He arrived back to Croatia on 22 September 2022, after which Croatian doctors checked his health in Clinical Hospital Dubrava.

The Rugby League Divisional Premiership (sometimes called the Second Division Premiership) was a competition for British rugby league clubs in the Second Division of the Rugby Football League, which operated between 1986 and 1997. 

==History==

The Second Division Premiership was introduced during the 1986–87 season. The format was the same as the Premiership competition used for First Division clubs, with the teams finishing in the top eight in the league competing in an end-of-season knockout tournament. The final was staged at Old Trafford as a curtain raiser for the First Division Premiership final, with the man of the match being awarded the Tom Bergin Trophy.

When a Third Division was introduced in the 1991–92 season, the competition was renamed the Divisional Premiership, and was expanded to include both Second and Third Division teams. The competition returned to the previous format when the league reverted to two divisions in the 1993–94 season.

Following the switch to summer rugby, a shortened four-team format was used for the 1996 competition. In 1998, the competition was replaced by a play-off system which would determine promotion to the Super League. The Tom Bergin Trophy continued to be used as the Grand Final's man of the match award.

[[Selonia military training area]]

CATEGORIES: Military installations of Latvia

Selonia military training area (Sēlijas militārais poligons) or Zalve military training area (Zalves poligons) is a planned international military base in Latvia.

==Plan==

Selonia military zone is a planned international military base and zone to be located in the South of the country between Aizkraukles and Jēkabpils Municipalities. The Ministry of Defense plans to take over 24,5 K hectares of land owned by state forestry company Latvijas valsts meži as well as 1 K hectares of private land  in accordance to a special law. On 21 June, 2023, the government passed a new law that would designating it as an area of "national interest", which ensures expedited governing and construction. The construction is planned in several stages, with the first stage completion planned by the end of 2025, with an estimated investment of 38 million EUR.

==Background==

At the 2022 Madrid summit, a commitment was made to significantly increase NATO deployments to Latvia and the other Baltic states in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  On July 5, Minister of Defense Artis Pabriks announced the plans to establish another international military zone and base (in addition to Ādaži military zone). At the time, the Canada-led NATO battlegroup in Latvia comprised about 1,700 soldiers from 10 countries. Pabriks and Canada's Minister of National Defence Anita Anand signed a declaration to NATO's expanded presence in Latvia and battleground strengthening and development. The new commitment was to increase the combat-ready personnel from a group size to a brigade size – 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers. Pabriks remarked that Latvia would have to commit to co-financing the new military infrastructure. Canada on its part committed to lead the group and cooperate with other NATO members for co-financing of infrastructure. At the time, the NATO forces were based at the Ādaži military zone's camp which was insufficient for the additional large numbers of reinforcements, including infrastructure, services and amenities for soldiers and support staff. Pabriks explained that minimizing the inconvenience to citizens was the primary criteria for the choice of the location, as well as proximity to Lithuania, historical significance and potential for economic growth for the two municipalities. In January 2023, NBS commander Leonīds Kalniņš said that development will begin this year so that that larger groups than possible in Ādaži can begin training as soon as possible.

==Environmental impact==

As of 2022, the majority of the area is forests, meadows and agricultural land. Pabriks stated that the military zone will be established in an area rich in animal habitats that the armed forces will respect and not endanger. Local residents will be able to continue to gather mushrooms and berries in most of the military zone, and the movement on regional and national roads will not be prohibited. A new law set new restrictions for hunting and specified that protected nature territories may be established in the military zones, but no new micro-reserves.

==Economic impact==

Pabriks noted that base should be a boost to the local businesses comparing it to the experience with Ādaži base. Regional business owners and politicians were hopeful about the potential economic opportunities and growth, while local farmers remained more sceptical and concerned about managing their land. While the exact project scope remains unknown, it is expected that there will be new road and infrastructure projects. Businesses were hopeful that this would increase the number of customers, but also noted that the priority was keeping the current businesses open during the economic situation rather than expansion.

Ibn ‘Abbād, also known as Benavert, was the last Emir of Sicily. He was the Emir of Syracuse, and from 1072 to 1086 he led the last Arab resistance against the Normans, who were conquering Sicily.

In 1075 he defeated Jordan of Hauteville, the son of Grand Count Roger I, at Catania, and he reconquered the city in 1081. In 1085 he led some expeditions to Reggio, in Calabria. On 25 may 1086, while Roger I was besieging Syracuse, he fell into the sea while jumping from a boat to the other, and died because of his heavy armor. His wife and his son fled to the city of Noto, which also fell together with Butera, in 1091.

One of his descendants, Muhammad ibn ‘Abbād, rebelled to Frederick of Sicily at the start of the 13th century, dying during the rebellion.

[[Names of the Scythians]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnonyms, Scythians

The names of the Scythians are a topic of interest for classicists and linguists. The Scythians were an Iranic people best known for dominating much of the Pontic steppe from about 700 BC to 400 BC. The name of the Scythians is believed to be of Indo-European origin and to have meant "archer". The Scythians gave their name to the region of Scythia. The Persians referred to all Iranian nomads of the steppes, including the Scythians, as Sakas. Some modern scholars apply the name Scythians to all peoples of the Scytho-Siberian world, but this terminology is controversial.

==Etymology==

Linguist Oswald Szemerényi studied synonyms of various origins for en and differentiated the following terms: grc (Σκυθης), peo (𐎿𐎤𐎢𐎭𐎼), peo (𐎿𐎢𐎦𐎢𐎭) and peo (𐎿𐎣𐎠).

From the Indo-European root (s)kewd-, meaning "propel, shoot" (and from which was also derived the English word en), of which *skud- is the zero-grade form, was descended from the Scythians' self-name reconstructed by Szemerényi as xsc (roughly "archer"). The collective endonym of the Scythians, xsc, was formed by the addition of the suffix xsc, which denoted the plural form.

From xsc were descended the following exonyms:

A late Scythian sound change from /δ/ to /l/ resulted in the evolution of xsc into xsc, from which was derived the collective endonym of the Scythians at a later date, xsc, formed by the addition of the plural suffix xsc. This designation was recorded in Greek as grc Σκωλοτοι, which, according to Herodotus of Halicarnassus, was the self-designation of the Royal Scythians.

Due to the sound change of /δ/ into /l/, the derivation of Old Persian peo was instead likely done indirectly from the Median language, which had preserved the older Scythian form xsc due to early contacts between the Medes and the Scythians during the 7th century BC, before the sound change from /δ/ to /l/ was complete.

Other sound changes have produced peo 𐎿𐎢𐎦𐎢𐎭.

From an Iranian verbal root sak-, "go, roam" and thus meaning "nomad" was derived the term Saka, from which came the names:

==Identification==

The name peo was used by the ancient Persians to refer to all the Iranian nomadic tribes living to the north of their empire, including both those who lived between the Caspian Sea and the Hungry steppe, and those who lived to the north of the Danube and the Black Sea. The Assyrians meanwhile called these nomads the Ishkuzai (7 akk, 7 akk), and the Ancient Greeks called them Skuthai (Σκυθης grc, Σκυθοι grc, Σκυθαι grc).

The Achaemenid inscriptions initially listed a single group of peo. However, following Darius I's campaign of 520 to 518 BC against the Asian nomads, they were differentiated into two groups, both living in Central Asia to the east of the Caspian Sea:

A third name was added after the Darius's campaign north of the Danube:

An additional term is found in two inscriptions elsewhere:

Moreover, Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions mention two group of Sakas:

The scholar David Bivar had tentatively identified the egy with the peo, and John Manuel Cook had tentatively identified the egy with the peo. More recently, the scholar Rüdiger Schmitt has suggested that the egy and the egy might have collectively designated the peo/grc.

==Late antiquity==

In Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the name "Scythians" was used in Greco-Roman and Byzantine literature for various groups of nomadic "barbarians" living on the Pontic-Caspian steppe who were not related to the actual Scythians, such as the Huns, Goths, Ostrogoths, Turkic peoples, Pannonian Avars, Slavs, and Khazars. For example, Byzantine sources referred to the Rus' raiders who attacked Constantinople in 860 AD in contemporary accounts as "Tauroscythians" because of their geographical origin, and despite their lack of any ethnic relation to Scythians.

==Modern terminology==

The Scythians were part of the wider Scytho-Siberian world, stretching across the Eurasian Steppes of Kazakhstan, the Russian steppes of the Siberian, Ural, Volga and Southern regions, and eastern Ukraine. In a broader sense, Scythians has also been used to designate all early Eurasian nomads, although the validity of such terminology is controversial, and other terms such as "Early nomadic" have been deemed preferable.

Although the Scythians, Saka and Cimmerians were closely related nomadic Iranian peoples, and the ancient Babylonians, ancient Persians and ancient Greeks respectively used the names "Cimmerian," "Saka," and "Scythian" for all the steppe nomads, and early modern historians such as Edward Gibbon mistakenly used the term Scythian to refer to a variety of nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples across the Eurasian steppe, the name "Scythian" in contemporary modern scholarship generally refers to the nomadic Iranian people who dominated the Pontic steppe from the 7th century BC to the 3rd century BC, while the name "Saka" is used specifically for their eastern members who inhabited the northern and eastern Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin;May 2021 and while the Cimmerians were often described by contemporaries as culturally Scythian, they formed a different tribe from the Scythians proper, to whom the Cimmerians were related, and who also displaced and replaced the Cimmerians in the Pontic Steppe.

The Scythians shared several cultural similarities with other populations living to their east, in particular similar weapons, horse gear and Scythian art, which has been referred to as the Scythian triad. Cultures sharing these characteristics have often been referred to as Scythian cultures, and its peoples called Scythians. Peoples associated with Scythian cultures include not only the Scythians themselves, who were a distinct ethnic group, but also Cimmerians, Massagetae, Saka, Sarmatians and various obscure peoples of the forest steppe, such as early Slavs, Balts and Finnic peoples.

Within this broad definition of the term Scythian, the actual Scythians have often been distinguished from other groups through the terms Classical Scythians, Western Scythians, European Scythians or Pontic Scythians. Nevertheless, the archaeologist Maurits Nanning van Loon in 1966 instead used the term Western Scythians to designate the Cimmerians and referred to the Scythians proper as the Eastern Scythians.

Scythologist Askold Ivantchik notes with dismay that the term "Scythian" has been used within both a broad and a narrow context, leading to a good deal of confusion. He reserves the term "Scythian" for the Iranian people dominating the Pontic steppe from the 7th century BC to the 3rd century BC. Nicola Di Cosmo writes that the broad concept of "Scythian" to describe the early nomadic populations of the Eurasian steppe is "too broad to be viable," and that the term "early nomadic" is preferable.

[[Fire and Rescue Academy of Malaysia]]

CATEGORIES: Firefighting academies, 1957 establishments in Malaya

The Fire and Rescue Academy of Malaysia (Abbr.: FRAM; Akademi Bomba dan Penyelamat Malaysia) is a tertiary education institution in Malaysia that specialises in fire and safety education and training. The Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia manages the academy, and enrollment is open to the general public. The institution offers education up through the advanced diploma level. FRAM has five campuses located around Malaysia.

==History==

===1940: Origin===

Formal firefighting training and curriculum were first introduced in Malaysia in Penang in 1940. The British Military Administration is in charge of the training, and A. J. Brown was appointed as its first officer in command. The trainers have a total of 150 personnel. In 1952, the Jemaah Pemeriksa Perkhidmatan Bomba ('Fire Service Inspectorate Board') standardised all fire department training in Malaya. They do not have permanent training facilities at this time, so they move from one fire station to another to train the firefighters.

===1957: First school===

The first permanent firefighting school was established in Gombak, Selangor, in 1957. It was known as the Sekolah Latihan Bomba Malayan Union ('Fire School of Malayan Union'). Lieutenant Colonel Watkins was the school's first commandant. At the time, the Fire Services Inspectorate Panels were in charge of the school. It was used by the military, state fire agencies, and public workers to learn how to fight fires.

===1972: Larger training centre===

To meet the growing demand for firefighters in Malaysia, a new fire training centre was established in Kuala Kubu Bharu in 1972. The school, known as Pusat Latihan Bomba Malaysia Kuala Kubu Bharu ('Malaysian Firefighter Training Centre Kuala Kubu Bharu'), was constructed on 13 acres of land. Before the training centres were renamed the current name in 1997, two more training centres were built.

===1997: Renamed to the Fire and Rescue Academy of Malaysia===

The centre's present name was adopted on 8 January 1997. This change corresponds to the formal renaming of the 'Malaysian Fire Services Department' to the 'Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia'.

==Functions and roles==

The Fire and Rescue Academy of Malaysia (FRAM) and its campuses are tasked with providing formal education in fire and safety, both practical and theoretical, to its students. Except for the Malaysian Volunteer Fire Brigade, all members of the Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia (FRDM) and Malaysian Auxiliary Fire Brigade are required to be trained at FRAM. The academy's primary functions are as follows:

==Campuses==

The FRAM has five campuses that are named after the regions in which they are located. Only the FRAM Central Region campus offers courses to international students. Aside from that, the FRAM Eastern Region campus is Asia's largest fire training and teaching institution. The five campuses are as follows:

==Courses available==

FRAM offers five different departments of specialisation. Some courses are only open to specific units, while some are available to the general public. The departments are as follows:

===Department of Fire Suppression Studies===

The School of Operations was the name given to Department of Fire Suppression Studies. The primary objective of this department is to instruct and train firefighters in fire suppression skills and procedures. Aside from that, this department is responsible for educating firefighters about any firefighting improvements. The following are some of the courses offered through this department:

===Department of Rescue Studies===

The Rescue Studies department was previously a part of the School of Operations before being separated to focus exclusively on teaching rescue capabilities. The School of Operations was later renamed the Department of fire suppression studies The majority of the courses offered here are exclusive to FRDM's special operations firefighters. The following are some of the courses offered through this department:

===Department of Fire Management Studies===

Fire Management Studies is a department that teaches a wide range of subjects. They provided education in areas such as IT, sports science, administration, logistics, music, and many more. This is FRAM's sole department that offers courses up to the diploma level. The following are some of the courses offered through this department:

===Department of Fire Safety Studies===

Fire Safety Studies is a fire prevention-focused department. This department is also in charge of law enforcement education pertaining to Undang-Undang Kecil Bangunan Seragam 1984-Pindaan 2012, which is mostly related to licensing and regulations. This department regularly holds seminars and workshops to educate the public on fire safety and awareness. The following are some of the courses offered through this department:

===Department of Fire Investigation Studies===

The Fire Investigation Studies was formerly known as the FRDM's Centre for the Study of Law. The FRDM's legal department in Putrajaya was originally in charge of the fire investigation. Fire investigation activities were previously handled by the FRDM's headquarters, but due to recent changes, each state's branch now has its own fire investigation team. Today, the headquarters is still mostly in charge of legal matters, but each branch's fire investigation team is in charge of forensics and law enforcement. This department is in charge of providing legal and law enforcement education to all firefighters. The following are some of the courses offered through this department:

[[Chilton Priory]]

CATEGORIES: History of Somerset, Towers in Somerset, Listed towers in the United Kingdom, Folly towers in England, Grade II listed buildings in Somerset, Monuments and memorials in Somerset, Towers completed in 1838, Observation towers in the United Kingdom

Chilton Priory (ST373389) (sometimes Stradling's Tower) is a Grade 2 listed folly, later extended to become a country house prominently located on Polden Hill, overlooking Bath Road, close to Chilton Polden, Parish of Polden Wheel, Somerset. The tower was erected in 1838 for William Stradling, deputy lieutenant of Somerset and a descendent of the local Stradling family who date back to the fourteenth century. The building commands extensive views over Somerset, including Glastonbury Tor. The first Ordnance Survey of 1886 records the tower and pleasure ground as 'Chilton Priory (Museum)'.

==The Folly and the later mansion==

Stradling refers to it as the 'Priory of Chilton-Super-Polden in his book of 1839. Built as a landmark it was also designed to be functional. The folly is a three-storey tower containing the Charles and Victoria rooms, with an observatory, nave, refectory, oratory and a crypt below, with a wing at the rear were built in 1838, probably by the architect William Halliday, for the antiquarian and art collector William Stradling to house his acquisitions. A plaque recording the name 'G. Dowden 1836' is set into the top of the tower above the doorway. Stradling did not live at Chilton Priory, his abode was at Roseville, now The Towers House in the village, located within a small park which also possessed a grotto, bridge and temple.

Stradling acquired and incorporated materials from the Roman Villa at Chedzoy; an old church at Langport provided the pinnacles; the grotesque heads, the upper windows and battlements came from a demolished castle at Enmore; staircase turret from a church in Shepton Mallet and three of the nave windows came from a chapel at Slapeland. The buildings have several gargoyles. The single storey wing attached to east of tower has lancet windows and the gabled porch to the south has a fine door dated 1616. The south and east ranges have two storeys with stone mullioned windows.

The refectory has some mediaeval stained glass, a fireplace set in a massive freestone surround and a 17th-century altar rail. Inset above in the fireplace surround is an example of one of the eighteen sculptural works that she produced. This 1910 work, 'Magna Mater' (Great Mother), has links with Cybele and was commissioned by Elbert and Alice Hubbard. The roof has gilt and oak rosettes from the Church of Glastonbury and on one of the beams is an elegantly carved scrawl surmounted by some tabernacle work, painted blue and red, ornamented with gold, taken from York Minster after the fire caused by an incendiary in WW2. The small Oratory at the east end has a floor of ancient monastic tiles from the Abbeys of Glastonbury and Tintern.

Stradling was a Freemason and a member of the 'Lodge of Perpetual Friendship in Bridgewater. This refectory has 'a black and white stone floor, bordered with blue similar to those at Freemasons' Lodges,'but it is not known if the room was ever used for Masonic rituals. Stradling employed a Mr William Halleday as a warden, living in the Gothic Cottage.

After Stradling's death much of his extensive collection was dispersed and the priory left for a time to deteriorate. A catalogue of his collection still exists.

The first buildings are in Gothic style and a Tudor style used for the later additions with a mock-military theme. These additional buildings were added towards the mid 19th century and finally some 20th century alterations and additions were added, such as the attached garage and outbuildings to the east.

===The Pleasure gardens===

A wooded pleasure ground is located to the west of the folly tower and this also housed items from Stradling's collection. The gardens are laid out on a slope with a tall retaining wall behind running parallel to the Bath Road that forms its south boundary. In 1839 Stradling published a book titled 'Description of the Priory of Chilton-Super-Polden'. He calls the grotto 'Pocock's Cell' after "a most extraordinary character, who for many years resided in a cavern a quarter of a mile from this spot." This anchorite's cavern, now collapsed, was "situated at the end of a long, deep, and narrow gulley, almost covered with briars: through which the stream runs that supplies Ford Mill". Pocock is described as the Robin Hood of this area, and he records an old rhyme: "Rvnne mye boyes, rvnne, the moon shynes bryte, Pocock's yn hys cave, hys pvrsse ys lyte; Bytte, whenne thee nygte ys mvrkye ande darke Hee's offe wythe hys steede, blythe as a larke."  In the early 20th century Major Kennedy extended the gardens by adding a terrace and lawns to the north of his new house.  In 1918 Frederick Bligh Bond was employed by John and Katharine Maltwood, to further extend the house and to add a pond and a bridge into the gardens.

===The Grotto and tunnel===

As stated, Circa 1839 Stradling built a rustic single-celled and circular grotto 'Pocock's Cell' with an accompanying gently curving Gothic-arched 'dark' tunnel in his pleasure grounds, both covered with soil. The stonework in both cases is entirely exposed. The grotto has a Gothic-arched entrance, steps leading down, domed ceiling with a small circular opening to let in light and the circular chamber contains three niches with Gothic-arches niches. A wrought iron entrance gate was once present. The structures are Grade 2 Listed.

===The Grail Frieze===

Circa 1920 Katharine made the Grail Frieze which she placed in a position overlooking the gardens. It is inscribed it with a quote from Sir William Dugdale's 1655 'Monasticum Anglicanum.' It is approximately 4m long, constructed of large stone ashlar blocks with an irregular, stepped top, and is inscribed: "About sixty three years After the incarnation Of our Lord St Joseph Of Arimethea, Accompanied by Eleven Other disciples of St Philip was despatched By that apostle into Britain to introduce The Meek and Gentle System of Christianity They settled in the Isle of Avalon." The Grail Frieze may have been intended to have an architectural function.

==Major Francis Kennedy==

Major Kennedy owned Chilton Priory from 1909 until 1918. In 1909–10 he commissioned Frederick Bligh bond, an architect, author and psychical researcher to build a larger Tudor-Gothic-revival house on to the north-east side of the early 19th century folly tower, copying the castellated design of the original building.

==The Maltwoods==

The Priory was home to the artist Katharine Emma Maltwood (1878–1961) née Sapsworth and her husband John from shortly after WWI. She is best known as the discoverer of the Glastonbury Zodiac or Temple of the Stars), a supposed enormous geomantic creation, the inspiration for which came to her in a dream, that was thought to exist around Glastonbury Tor, defined by ancient landscape features.

John Maltwood made his fortune in WWI as managing director of Oxo Ltd who had a contract to supply combatants with their products. Katharine was a scholar, collector and artist, her early work being greatly influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement and others. The couple travelled widely and were especially interested in the culture and art of countries such as Arabia, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, North Africa, Palestine and Vietnam.

Katharine believed that William Stradling had deliberately built Chilton Priory on an early British pilgrimage route to Glastonbury and an ancient road 5 feet wide was indeed coincidentally discovered during building works at the priory, running parallel to the then toll road. In the 1920s she became increasingly interested in ancient mythology, religious mysticism and spirituality. She made a detailed study of medieval Arthurian legends, in particular the visit by Joseph of Arimethea bearing the Holy Grail to Glastonbury.  Katharine's study was in the small room at the top of the west tower.

In 1935 the couple moved from Chilton Priory and in 1938 they sold it and moved to Canada. A number of others occupied the priory, however the Bath Road became increasingly busy, detracting from the privacy of the property. After a long period of disuse in 2015 the estate was sold at auction and Chilton Priory is now privately owned.

[[Battle of Herat (1598)]]

CATEGORIES: Battles involving Safavid Iran

Battle of Herat (1598) — It is a battle that took place on August 9, 1598, between the Shaybanid Khanate and the Safavid Empire for Khorasan and Balkh. The battle resulted in the complete defeat of the Uzbeks and Safavid Empire fully restored its power in Khorasan and got back the region.

==Background==

During the reign of Shah Muhammad Khudabanda, the Safavid Empire was experiencing deep internal turmoil. During this period of turmoil, in which the Shah's weakness played an important role, the empire was attacked by its neighbors to the east and west. In 1578, Shaybanids which took an advantage of the Ottoman Empire's declaration of war on the Safavid Empire, attacked the Safavids from the east. The Ottoman-Shaybanid alliance forced the Safavid Empire to wage war on two fronts. After the defeat against the Ottoman Empire in the west, the Astrakhanid dynasty, which replaced the Shaybanid dynasty, attacked Khorasan and captured it.September 2022

In 1587, Shah Mohammad Khodabanda was succeeded by his young son Shah Abbas. He set himself the task of returning all the lost lands. Shah Abbas, who signed an unpleasant peace with the Ottoman Empire, started reforms including an active army and tried to centralize his state.October 2022 Despite the fact that the most dangerous enemy of the Safavid Empire was on its western border, Shah Abbas was aware that it would be very difficult to fight them yet. Therefore, he decided that it would be more appropriate to eliminate the threat of the enemy in the east at the first stage. In 1597, Shah Abbas began a campaign against the Uzbeks. Many of the main cities of Khorasan were captured. Mashhad was easily subordinated to the Safavid army. However, the Uzbek commander Din Mohammad escaped alive and managed to escape to Herat. On August 9, 1598, the Safavid army approached Herat.September 2022

==Battle==

Shah Abbas, seeing the strengthening of Herat's fortress walls, was aware that the siege of the fortress could last for a very long time. Therefore, he was able to force the Uzbek army to leave the castle by using false retreat tactics. The Uzbek army that left the fortress was surrounded and defeated by the Safavid army. Din Mohammad, the Uzbek commander, was wounded in the battle and killed by his own fighters on the way back.

==Result==

With the successful conclusion of this campaign, the Safavid Empire not only regained Khorasan, but also dealt a blow to its main rival in the east, which ensured the security of its eastern borders. Thus, the Uzbek army was dealt such a heavy blow in the battle of 1598 that they could not recover their forces for a long time and enter into an open struggle with the Safavid Empire. Shah Abbas focused on the issue of war with the Ottoman Empire only after ensuring the security of the eastern borders, which he attached great importance to, and started this war in 1603. As a result of this war, great victories were won over the Ottoman army.

[[2003–04 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season]]

CATEGORIES: Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey seasons, 2003–04 WCHA men's ice hockey season, 2003–04 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey by team, 2003 in sports in Colorado, 2004 in sports in Colorado, NCAA men's ice hockey Frozen Four seasons

The 2003–04 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season was the 55th season of play for the program and 45th in the WCHA. The Pioneers represented the University of Denver in the 2003–04 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Magness Arena and were coached by George Gwozdecky, in his 10th season. The team won the 2004 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the 6th title in program history.

==Season==

Entering the season, Denver was in a bit of a slump. The Pioneers were seven years removed from their last NCAA tournament win and had made just 1 appearance in the Frozen Four since 1972. While the team was ranked entering the season, Denver was outside the top-10 and not one of the favorites to challenge for the championship. The Pioneers started well, winning their first six games of the year, but they stumbled a bit once they began their conference schedule. Splits against schools like Minnesota and Colorado College didn't harm their standing, however, getting badly beaten twice by North Dakota at home didn't engender much faith from the voters. The Pioneers played up and down though the first half of their season but did settle on a few facts; Adam Berkhoel was their starting goalie and without him they didn't have much of a chance.

As the season progressed, it became apparent that while Denver could score goals, they did not have the high-end offense that some of their contemporaries did. None of the players reached 20 goals on the year and only Gabe Gauthier managed to average a point per game. On the back end, their defense was no juggernaut either; while allowing 27 shots against per game wasn't bad, it was hardly world-beating. Berkhoel was key for the team's chances and while he turned in several sterling performances, the senior netminder would go through bad stretches during the season. Denver also had a slight disadvantage of playing in the WCHA, which was typically regarded as the best conference in college hockey. When they hit the winter break, Denver had a solid record overall but were under .500 in conference play. After resuming their season in January, Denver won 4 games in a row but then followed that up with a 1–4–1 stretch against WCHA teams. With their ranking having dropped to #12, the Pioneers were in danger of missing out on the NCAA Tournament and needed to arrest their slide.

After a week off at the beginning of February, the Pioneers appeared to steady themselves and didn't drop another game for the remainder of the regular season. The team went 7–0–1 over the final four weeks and put themselves into the top-5. With their postseason position essentially guaranteed, Denver began the conference tournament against long-time rival Colorado College at home. After a lackluster loss in the first game, Denver's defense collapsed and allowed 6 goals to the Tigers. The poor performance knocked the Pioneers out and dropped their ranking by several spots. While the team would still make the national tournament, the losses meant that they would have to open against a stronger opponent in the first game.

===NCAA Tournament===

Denver's final ranking by the selection committee was 8th, good enough for the final 2-seed and a spot in the Western Regional final, located in Colorado Springs. Behind a partisan crowd, the Pioneers took on Miami and got off to a good start. team captain Ryan Caldwell opened the scoring with a short-handed marker in the first and then played a strong defensive game to hold off the RedHawks. The two traded goals in the final two periods but Miami was never able to tie the game and Denver skated away with a narrow victory.

For their second match of the tournament, Denver had to go through the #1 overall seed, North Dakota. The Fighting Sioux had easily taken the season series and were looking to put the Pioneers down with another embarrassing loss but Berkhoel would have none of it. While Denver was outshot 17–33 in the game, not a single one went into the Pioneer cage. Denver's offense was anemic all game and the scoresheet sat empty for over 57 minutes. Just when it appeared that overtime was inevitable, junior Luke Fulghum deflected a shot from Max Bull into the net. North Dakota desperately tried to even the score but the horn sounded before they would score and Denver was off to Boston.

In the national semifinal, things couldn't have started worse for the Pioneers. Minnesota–Duluth scored twice in the first five minutes of the game and, after Denver gave Duluth four additional power play opportunities, it appeared that the Bulldogs were going to roll over the Pioneers. Somehow, Berkhoel and the defense held and prevented UMD's lead from increasing. A more even second period gave Denver the chance they needed and Fulghum cut the lead in half near the mid-point of the game. Unfortunately, a 6th power play opportunity for Minnesota–Duluth saw them regain their 2-goal edge and Denver needed a mammoth effort in the final frame if they wanted their season to continue. The Pioneers came out swinging in the third and Connor James scored in the third minute. Just 34 seconds later, Caldwell added a marker and suddenly Denver was in a tie game. Duluth called a timeout to settle their players down but Denver had all the momentum and they continued to press the attack. Lukas Dora, who had taken the penalty that had led to UMD's third goal, redeemed himself by giving Denver its first lead of the game. The defense then turned in a masterful performance to limit the Bulldog's scoring opportunities and the Pioneers bled the clock for the final 11 minutes. An empty-net goal sealed the deal and put Denver in the championship match for the first time in 35 years.

In the final game of the year, Maine was all that stood between Denver and the program's 6th title. While the Black Bears had a good offense, they had produced one of the top defensive seasons in the history of college hockey. The opposition was led by goaltender Jimmy Howard, who had set numerous NCAA records that season, including save percentage and goals against average. Playing as the underdog, Denver got off to a slow start and allowed Maine to open the scoring on their first power play of the game. The Pioneers were then beneficiaries of a very controversial ruling by the officials when the goal was waved off. Mike Hamilton was ruled to have committed a crease violation by having his skate be inside the protected area before the puck entered the goal crease. While he had not materially contributed to the goal, it was enough of an infraction to wave off the goal, much to the ire of the partisan audience. Seven minutes later, while on a power play of their own, James found Gauthier alone in the slot and the senior center scored the first official goal of the game. Neither team played particularly well on offense for the rest of the contest and it was typified by strong defensive play and penalties. Over the final two periods, the two teams combined for twelve minor penalties and six power play opportunities but just 34 shots. Denver was able to ride its narrow lead for most of the game and as time ticked away they grew closer and closer to the title. With just over 2 minutes left on the clock, Matt Laatsch was called for hooking and sent Maine to the power play for the 6th time that night. On one of the Black Bears' zone entries, Gabe Gauthier snagged the puck out of the air and tossed it back down the ice. The referees ruled that he had closed his hand on the puck and handed him a 2-minute penalty for delay of game. Now Denver found itself having to defend a 3-on-5 disadvantage for the final 90 seconds of the game, a situation made all the more precarious when Maine pulled their goaltender to give them twice as many skaters as the Pioneers. The final stretch of the game would go down in college hockey lore as one of the more stunning defensive efforts but neither the defense nor Berkhoel nor the post would give an inch and Maine failed to score. A missed pass to the point helped Denver run out the clock and win the national championship.

[[Qué Pasa (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Gato Barbieri albums, 1997 albums, Columbia Records albums

Qué Pasa is an album by the Argentine musician Gato Barbieri, released in 1997. It was his first studio album in more than a decade. Barbieri supported it with a North American tour. The album was a hit on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz Album chart.

==Production==

The album was produced by Philippe Saisse. Barbieri and Saisse opted for more of a smooth jazz sound, and also incorporated synthesizers and programmed drums. "The Woman I Remember" is a tribute to Barbieri's late wife. "Blue Gala" is dedicated to the physical therapist who aided Barbieri after his 1995 heart surgery. "Mystica" is an interpretation of Erik Satie's Gymnopédies. Barbieri regretted that the album was around an hour in running time, which he thought was too long.

==Critical reception==

The Record deemed the album "a softer blend of Latin hip-hop," writing that "it often is overloaded with the unnatural, plasticized sounds brought on by programming and overdubbing." Hispanic noted that "Barbieri's one-of-a-kind muscular tone is sensual and exotic, with a universal appeal that makes his music timeless pop." The Jerusalem Post concluded that, "having traveled, over the course of three decades, from primeval, screaming wildness to soft, minimal whispers, Barbieri now steers an elegant, knowing, and sensuous middle course."

AllMusic wrote that Barbieri "does little other than state the 11 melodies (which range from catchy to completely forgettable), and the backing is quite anonymous, over-produced and obviously geared for potential radio airplay." MusicHound Jazz: The Essential Album Guide gave the album a rare zero-star rating (woof!).

Sarah Catherine Clarke FRCP FESC FACC is a British consultant cardiologist and has served as the president of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) of London since September 2022.

==Early life and education==

Clarke was born in 1965. She studied medicine at Girton College, University of Cambridge, graduating in 1989. After completing junior hospital jobs locally, she chose to specialise in cardiology and trained at the Royal Papworth Hospital and Addenbrooke's Hospital. Clarke completed a fellowship in interventional cardiology at Harvard University in 2001 and the following year became a consultant cardiologist. In 2004, she obtained an MD from the University of Cambridge. Two years later Clarke was elected as a fellow of the RCP (London). She is also a fellow of the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology.

==Research and career==

She served as the president of the British Cardiovascular Society between 2015 and 2018 and was the first woman to hold the role. In 2017, she was appointed as a joint national lead for cardiology for the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) programme. Clarke is the deputy chair of the British Heart Foundation and the clinical director for strategic development at Royal Papworth Hospital. Clarke was the clinical vice-president of the RCP (London) between 2019 and 2022. She was selected by the RCP council to become the president of the RCP (London) in July 2022. This was after geriatrician David Oliver, the winner of the presidential election in April, withdrew from the presidency in July for personal reasons. Clarke became president on 14 September 2022, the fourth woman in its 504-year history to hold the position.

In an interview with The Times, published on 24 September 2022, Clarke advised junior doctors not to go on strike as although she sympathised with their concerns she felt that it would impact on patient care. She later clarified her comments and stated that the RCP supported the rights of trade union members to take industrial action. The British Medical Association (BMA), a doctors' trade union, responded to the article by criticising her advice against strikes. They felt that the "greatest risk to patient care" was from "government policies and a lack of coherent workforce plan" and asked for her to apologise. Clarke sent an apologetic message to RCP members two days later, in which she criticised the headline of the article as being "misrepresentative".

Clarke supports the doubling of medical school places to 15,000 which has been RCP policy since 2018.

[[Hypa Hypa]]

CATEGORIES: 2020 songs, Electronicore songs

"Hypa Hypa" is a song by German metal and trancecore band Electric Callboy (formerly Eskimo Callboy). The track is the first single from their second EP MMXX. The track gained notoriety in 2021 through its various reissues that the band released in collaboration with other musicians. The song reached number 77 on the German charts.

==Genesis and artwork==

The song was written by the band members Daniel Haniß, Kevin Ratajczak, Nico Sallach and Pascal Schillo. Recording and production resulted from the collaboration between Haniß, Ratajczak and Schillo. Haniß was also responsible for mixing the piece himself. The mastering was done by Pitchback Studio, under the direction of the owner Aljoscha Seig.

A screenshot from the accompanying music video can be seen on the front cover of the single. It shows the band in a 1980s style, in front of a convertible, four palm trees and a bright neon pink sun. The artist and song information consists of the inscription: 'Eskimo Callboy starring in Hypa Hypa'. The information is centred at the top of the cover image. Matthias Lowesnstein from Season Zero was responsible for the artwork. The concept came from the band itself. The cover image was first presented on 4 June 2020.

==Publishing and promotion==

Hypa Hypa was initially released as a single on 18 June 2020. The single was released as a digital download through the music label Century Media. It was distributed by Sony Music Publishing. On 11 September 2020, the song was released as part of Electric Callboy's second EP MMXX. In the first half of 2021, the band re-recorded the song with some guest vocalists. Some of these new recordings were released in April and May 2021 as singles and some were released as music videos. All singles, like the main track, were released as digital downloads and streaming. The first remix featured the medieval rock band Saltatio Mortis on 30 April 2021. It was followed by a feature from pop singer, Sasha on 7 May 2021. The hip-hop duo 257ers on 14 May 2021. The DJ duo GeStort aber GeiL, the metal singer Axel One, the metalcore band We Butter the Bread with Butter and the country band The BossHoss on 20 May 2021. On 21 May 2021, a new edition of the MMXX album was released called: 'Hypa Hypa edition'. This extended EP includes all the new remixes, as well as the unreleased featuring with guitarist Tobias Rauscher.

To promote the song, the band performed at Wacken World Wide 2020, among other music festivals.

==Background information==

Hypa Hypa is the first release from Electric Callboy to feature the new front man Nico Sallach, who was previously the lead singer of trancecore band To the Rats and Wolves. He replaced Sebastian 'Sushi' Biesler, who had left the band after ten years. Biesler announced his departure on 12 February 2020. After leaving the band, he formed Ghostkid.

==Content==

The lyrics to Hypa Hypa are in English and a reference to Hyper Hyper by Scooter. The term 'hypa' is a corruption of 'hyper' which comes from the Greek and can be translated as 'mega', 'super' or 'over'. The music and lyrics were originally written and composed by Electric Callboy members Danierl Haniß, Kevin Ratajcak, Nico Sallach and Pascal Schillo. The version with the 257ers contains lyrics in German, and only the chorus was taken over in the original. The two members of the 257ers, Mike Rohleder and Daniel Schneider appear as additional authors. Musically, the song moves in the field of metalcore. The tempo is 76 beats per minute and the key is E major.

==Music video==

The music video was shot in Castrop-Rauxel and premiered on YouTube on 19 June 2020. A first teaser was presented on 4 June 2020, when Sallach was officially confirmed as the new lead singer. During the shooting, the band received support from influencers such as _alienxbaby_ or HandOfBlood. The video was shot in the style of the 1980s and uses stylistic devices such as Hawaiian shirts, neon colours or a mullet-Hairstyle. It can be divided into three scenes. First, you see the band playing the song. On the other hand you see _alienxbaby_, who plays with things in an ambiguous way or poses lasciviously in front of a Ferrari convertible. Another scene shows the other influencers dancing to the song. The total length of the video is 3:31 minutes. The Schillo brothers Oliver and Pascal, who also directed VIP and Prism, directed the film. The music video has over 34 million views on YouTube to date (as of 25 July 2023).

In addition, music videos for the versions with Sasha (7 May 2021), 257ers (14 May 2021), We Butter the Bread with Butter (21 May 2021) and Axel One (25 May 2021) have also been released, leading to the for the most part also take up the stylistic devices of the 1980s. Ratajczak and Sallach have guest appearances in all videos; _alienxbaby_ also appears in the videos of the 257ers and Sasha.

==Success==

Approx. one year after its initial release, Hypa Hypa managed to enter the German single charts at 77 on 28 May 2021. It is the first song by Electric Callboy achieving a chart entry overall. Before that, Hypa Hypa charted in the German single trends charts, reaching no. 1 on 16 June 2020 which indicated that an entry in the official single charts was missed barely.

CATEGORIES: Rare genetic syndromes, Congenital disorders of nervous system, Central nervous system disorders, Autosomal recessive disorders

Porencephaly-cerebellar hypoplasia-internal malformations syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome that mainly affects the central nervous system. It causes cardiac defects, brain anomalies, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. It has been reported in a pair of German siblings of the opposite sex born to consanguineous Turkish parents.

==Discovery==

This condition was first discovered in 1996 by Bonnemann and Meinecke, their patients were a pair of infant siblings of the opposite sex (brother and sister) who had multiple congenital anomalies, all of which were internal.

The siblings' parents were first-degree cousins of Turkish ancestry.

The both of them exhibited bilateral porencephaly, an underdeveloped cerebellum, an absent vermis, an absent septum pellucidum, and generalized internal malformations, most of which were unique to one another;

The brother was noted to have situs inversus totalis (a condition in which most to all organs of the body are facing the opposite way they would normally be facing) and tetralogy of Fallot (type of congenital cardiac defect).

The sister was noted to have an atrial septal defect (type of congenital cardiac defect).

They had cranio-facial dysmorphisms such as hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, prominence of the metopic suture, a high arched palate, and macrocephaly. Other features that were found in the siblings included epilepsy and corneal clouding.

[[Peronia platei]]

CATEGORIES: Wikipedia Student Program, Onchidiidae, Gastropods described in 1928

Peronia platei is a species of slug, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Onchidiidae, one of the families of sea slugs. Nine species of Peronia are recognized; the way to tell them apart is by DNA sequencing by mitochondrial and nuclear sequence or checking their internal anatomy. This species has hermaphroditic parts in the posterior regions of the deferent duct and straight oviduct. The male part is the muscular sac of the accessory penial gland in the anterior area. It is distributed across the entire tropical and subtropical Indo-West Pacific, from South Africa to Hawaii.

==Classification==

Intertidal sea slugs are gastropods belonging to the subclass Heterobranchia and the family Onchiididae. They share many characteristics of shell-less marine mollusks, including dorsal gills that are visible when relaxed and retracted when crawling during low tide.

==Distribution and habitat==

This species has a cosmopolitan distribution across the entire tropical and subtropical Indo-West Pacific, from South Africa to Hawaii. It prefers the rocky intertidal area, stays hidden in crevices such as the lagoon during high tide, and only comes out during low tide.

==Description==

Peronia platei has a body that isn't flattened and is grey colored with small rounded protrusions on the exterior surface. It has black dorsal eyes at the tip and gills present under the dorsal notum.Peronia platei has gills on its back (dorsalnotum) and has hermaphroditic parts in the posterior regions of the deferent duct and straight oviduct. The male part is the muscular sac of the accessory penial gland in the anterior area that is 5 mm long; the spine of the accessory penial gland is 0.9 mm long, narrow, elongated, straight, or slightly curved. The specimen has intestinal loops of type V and several dorsal papillae with eyes and rachidian and innermost lateral teeth. They breathe air using their gills and die if exposed to water for too long. The color of the dorsal notum is dark grey, including papillae; some papillae show black dorsal eyes at their tip, and the number of papillae with dorsal eyes varies (from 7 to 10). Its mantle (hyponotum) is light yellow, and the foot is pale yellow to orange. The ocular tentacles are grey, like the head.

==Human use==

This species is being used to study anatomical and systematic descriptions for future research. It is an indicator species that give clues about the health of the oceanic environment.

[[Cegeka]]

CATEGORIES: Belgian companies established in 1992, Information technology companies

Cegeka is a European provider of IT solutions, services and consultancy. The company was founded in 1992 and has data centers in Hasselt, Belgium and Geleen, the Netherlands. Anno 2020 CEO Stijn Bijnens leads the company from its headquarters in Hasselt. In 2020, the group had 5,000 employees and achieved a consolidated turnover of 640 million euros.

==History==

The Cegeka IT company was created as part of the Kempen Coal Mines (KS) reconversion plan. It was originally a joint venture between CSC, investment company Gimv and the KS. The name Cegeka is derived from the initial letters C, G and K of the founders. In 1992 Cegeka was split up: the computer center continued under the name VCST Computer Services, the software department with about 30 employees was taken over by then IT managers André Knaepen and Herman van Halen and continued under the name Cegeka. In 1996, following a capital increase by VCST Special Products, in which he had acquired the majority, Knaepen gained control of Cegeka and it became a family business.

Cegeka grew strongly through several acquisitions. In 1996, Cegeka took over the company ConnectIT. In 2000, the company, which supplies a lot of software to hospitals through its subsidiary Cegeka HealthCare Systems, already had 220 employees. In 2003, the company was named a Trends Gazelle by the weekly Trends magazine. It had sales of 22 million euros and supplied software to several large companies. In 2004 HostIT joined the Cegeka group and in 2006 followed the important acquisition of Ardatis, a company specializing in IT solutions for the social sector. In the same year, with a turnover of 40 million euros and a staff of 350, it received this award again. At the time, it had just acquired the Antwerp software company Cortex. In 2009, Cegeka became a major player in Wallonia thanks to a participation in NSI.

In 2010, Cegeka received the Ambiorix Prize from entrepreneurial organization VKW Limburg. This is the most important award that companies in the province of Limburg can receive.

Georgy Nikolaevich (or Mykolayovych) Vysotsky (Гео́ргий Никола́евич Высо́цкий; Heorhii Mykolaiovych Vysotskyi; 7 February 1865 – 6 April 1940) was a Ukrainian and Soviet soil scientist and forester who worked in the steppe, where he examined forest growth and the effects of soil factors.

Vysotsky was born in Nikitovka and went to the St. Petersburg Petrovsky Agricultural Academy in 1886, where he came under the influence of Vasily Dokuchaev and Georgy Fedorovich Morozov. He worked from 1890 at the Berdyansk Reserve and in 1892 joined Dokuchaev on an expedition to Poltava and became manager of the Great Anatolian forest reserve. There, he experimented on the use of forest strips to manage droughts. From 1904, he worked on experimental forestry near Samara. From 1913, he worked on reforestation of the steppe near Kiev and from 1918, he began to teach first in Kiev and then in Simferopol, Minsk and Kharkiv.

He conducted his research on forest growth and regrowth, studying soil hydrology, soil salinity and other factors. A major contribution was his approach to measuring the moisture balance of forests, which has been modified and goes by the name of Vysotsky-Ivanov moisture coefficient defined as the ratio of the annual precipitation to the annual evaporation. Based on that index, he suggested a land classification. In 1915 he received the Semenov-Tian-Shanskyi gold medal from the Russian geographical society.

[[Then Now and Inbetween]]

CATEGORIES: 1969 compilation albums, The Kinks compilation albums, Reprise Records compilation albums, Albums produced by Ray Davies, Albums produced by Shel Talmy, Promotional albums

Then Now and Inbetween is a promotional compilation album by the English rock band the Kinks. Reprise Records issued the album in Julynbsp1969 to journalists, radio program directors and disc jockeys in conjunction with the "God Save the Kinks" promotional campaign, which sought to reestablish the Kinks' commercial status in the US after their four-year ban on performing in the country.

==Background and release==

In Julynbsp1965, the Kinks were informally blacklisted from performing in the United States by the American Federation of Musicians. The circumstances that led to the ban are unclear but likely stemmed from several incidents during the band's first US tour; bandleader Ray Davies later attributed it to a combination of "bad luck, bad management, and bad behaviour".

The Kinks' ban persisted until Davies negotiated its resolution in mid-Aprilnbsp1969. In preparation for a return tour of America, the band's first there in over four years, Reprise Records and Warner Bros. Records initiated a promotional campaign to reestablish the band's commercial standing. On 3 July 1969, Davies and band manager Robert Wace attended a meeting with Reprise executives at Warner's headquarters in Burbank, California. Musician John Mendelsohn attended the meeting in an advisory role, having been hired after Reprise read his favourable review of the band's 1969 album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. The group formally launched the campaign under the moniker "God Save the Kinks". Mendelsohn came up with the title, which referenced the refrain "God save the village green!" from the close of the song "The Village Green Preservation Society".

As part of the campaign, Reprise mailed press kits to journalists, radio program directors and disc jockeys. The kits included Then Now and Inbetween and other assorted items, such as guide to the Kinks' recordings and a plastic bag with blades of grass from "Daviesland village green". The compilation album was also available to public via mail order for US$2 (US). The album has since become a valued collector's item.

==Music==

The songs on Then Now and Inbetween range chronologically from Julynbsp1964 to Octobernbsp1968 and are a mix of Shel Talmy- and Davies-produced recordings. All of the songs were recorded in the basement studios at Pye Records's London offices, except for "You Really Got Me", which was done at IBC Studios in London.

Then Now and Inbetween marked the first inclusion of "Days" on a US LP. It also featured "Berkeley Mews" a year before its first official release, as the UK B-side to the 1970 single  "Lola". The Kinks recorded "Berkeley Mews" in earlynbsp1968 during the sessions for Village Green, but band biographer Andy Miller hypothesises that the band may have overdubbed additional parts for the song in anticipation of its inclusion on Then Now and Inbetween. In particular, he focuses on elements which were generally absent from the band's 1968 work, such as the heavier guitar production and the presence of a saxophone. He suggests the saxophone may have been overdubbed around May or Junenbsp1969 during the sessions for Arthur (1969), since Dave Davies's song "Mr. Reporter" received a brass overdub around the same time.

==Plot==

Nawal is a singer and Maysa, a dancer, two friends who work in a mobile band whose owner is Mohsen, the imposter who took them to the city of El Mahalla El Kubra and took the revenue and ran away, so the owner of the hall had to expel them and they had to spend their night in the street because the owner of the hotel wanted the fare, but they found an empty car on the road, so they slept in it. When the owner of the car came, Dr. Wahid Kamel, who was on a home visit, and when he got into his car, he knew of their presence and they recognized him after he was misleading that they were teachers. Wahid saw Nawal again, and they are red to fall in love with each other and Wahid told his father, the Pasha that he wants to marry a school teacher, and he refused. Nawal came out of the theater at night in acting clothes and makeup, so the morals police suspected her and chased her, so she hid in the apartment of Abbas Hamed, the painter who drank a lot until he became drunk and told her that he would kill his uncle who was a guardian on him and stole all his inheritance, then he passed out. Nawal tried to take the keys from his pocket, but she couldn't, so she spent the night in the apartment, and in the morning she managed to take the keys and went out, while the police raided the apartment and arrested Abbas on charges of killing his uncle, who had been killed the night before and who had previously threatened to kill him in front of witnesses. Abbas managed to escape and searched for Nawal for she is the only witness to his innocence. Wahid offered to marry Nawal, but she evaded him and decided not to meet him again, because she lied to him about her job and understood that she was a teacher and did not tell him that she works as a singer in a hall. However, Maysa called  Wahid and told him the truth, so he became more attached to her and married her despite the objection of his father, the Pasha, who then agreed. Abbas called Nawal and asked her to help him and testify that she had spent the night in his apartment and asked her to meet him in his apartment again to agree to surrender himself and her testimony in his favor, so she went to him behind her husband’s back, who watched her and doubted her behavior and thought she is in an affair with Abbas, and he divorced her instantly. Nawal was unable to meet Abbas because the police arrested him, and when Wahid learned of Abbas’ story, he agreed for Nawal to testify in his favour, despite the scandal that this caused him, and indeed Nawal went to court and acquitted Abbas and testified that she had spent that night with him, so the court acquitted him and the real killer was arrested, and Abbas swore to Wahid that his wife is honest and that she was a victim of misfortune. Finally, Wahid remarried Nawal and remained happily ever after.

Elizabeth Schrader Polczer, better known as Elizabeth Schrader,  is an American biblical scholar who concentrates on textual studies concerning Mary Magdalene, the Gospel of John, and the Nag Hammadi corpus. Before transitioning to her academic focus,  she was a singer/songwriter professionally known as Libbie Schrader.  

Schrader grew up in Portland, Oregon and moved to California to attend Pomona College, from which she graduated in 2001. She moved to New York in 2008.

Schrader's involvement with religious scholarship began after a long and successful career as a singer-songwriter. In 2010 she launched a fan-funded campaign to record her album Magdalene. The album's title track led to Schrader doing research into Mary Magdalene in the Gospel of John, to two master's degrees in theology from General Theological Seminary, and to her current doctoral studies in Early Christianity and New Testament at Duke University. She currently resides in Durham, North Carolina.

==Scholarship==

Schrader is a textual critic who studies discrepancies between the earliest manuscripts of the gospels. She is particularly concerned with the many textual variants around the name Maria in manuscripts of John’s Gospel, and argues that such textual instabilities might be connected to controversies around Mary Magdalene in early Christianity. In her peer-reviewed articles Was Martha of Bethany Added to the Fourth Gospel in the Second Century?  and ’Rabbouni,’ which means Lord: Narrative Variants in John 20:16, she suggests that the earliest extant manuscripts of John’s Gospel may contain evidence of editorial attempts to minimize Mary Magdalene’s role in that gospel. In her peer-reviewed article The Meaning of ‘Magdalene’: A Review of Literary Evidence (co-written with Joan Taylor), Schrader and Taylor argue that the word “Magdalene” could be an honorific title, not necessarily referencing Mary’s hometown (which, Schrader argues, could be Bethany).

In 2022, Schrader presented the Carpenter Program Women’s History Month Lecture at Vanderbilt University, and she has made academic presentations at the Duke Divinity School and other universities.

==Music==

Schrader was the first winner of the Pantene Pro-Voice competition in 2001, after a performance opening for Jewel at SummerStage in New York's Central Park. That same year, Schrader's group, The Wash, won the inaugural Pantene Pro-Voice Competition. In 2002, Schrader's group, known then as Think of England was chosen to be a part of Jewel's Soul City Café program, and opened three shows on her This Way tour. She also opened for other artists as diverse as India.Arie, Michelle Branch, Ray LeMontagne, and Rusted Root.

After Schrader went solo, she was a featured artist on MySpace in early 2006 and appeared in the Gilmore Girls episode Partings later that year.

A 2017 article in The Oregonian noted that despite her recent involvement biblical scholarship, Schrader's songs still "...focus on secular themes of love and loss, desire and real-life events, both serious and light-hearted."

The Book of Deggua (መፅሃፈ ድጓ, De'guaa, means "lamentation") is a hymnary guideline of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches written by the six century composer Yared. The great Deggua is called Mahlete Yared (treasury). 

Yared prepared Deggua in three modes of chanting used by the church that is known as Ge'ez, Ezil and Araray, represent the Trinity, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit respectively. Ge'ez means the plain chant for ordinary days, Ezil means measured for funerals and Araray means lighter, free mode for great festivals.

The book contains many passages of the Creation, patristic works, hagiographies, homilies, etc.

==Content==

The book of Deggua contains Biblical events, passage of sacred books, patristic works, hagiographies, homilies, etc. The book author Yared divide services of the year, not only the seasons, but also with tract of Biblical history. The hymn talks about the Creation, the prophecies related to the birth of Jesus Christ, his life and teachings, and subsequent spread of Christian faith. More essentially, the Antediluvian period minimally written, namely to the act of Creation, the institution of Sabbath, and the building of Noah's Ark.

In the beginning, God made the Heaven and the Earth;

And having completed all, He rested on the Sabbath; 

And said He to Noah at the onset of the Flood:

Build yourself an Ark by which you may be saved.

Many hymns are sung months or weeks before and on the eve of Christmas extracted from Psalms and Books of the Prophets or merely slight variations on them. For instance, one hymn can be sung at Christmas Eve in different melodies, with different accompaniments of verse taken from Psalms 68.

The kings of Thrace and the islands offer presents;

The kings of Saba and Arabia bring gifts

To Him born of the Holy Virgin.

A related hymn concerns the Star of Bethlehem: 

The star became a guide

And, to them, a herald of joy.

On the Lent which fast are overdone for fifty-six days, hymns are chanted repeatedly to deeper significance, reminiscing the Oriental carving of the Three Monkeys, one covering its eyes the other its mouth, and third its ears.

Let the eyes fast;

Let the tongue fast;

And let the ears fast from hearing evil… 

And on the joyous occasion of Easter, the favorite hymn reads:

Christ has risen from the dead

With great power and authority;

He has put Satan in chains;

He has set Adam free

Peace! Henceforth, let there be peace.

Many of Yared's verses are adapted from the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Book of the Prophets and the New Testament. In such  a case, it is temporal order, both over the months and year, and in a single liturgy or choir, which he arranged throughout his life.

==Melodies==

Yared's three basis melodies are Ge'ez, Ezil and Araray that symbolize the Trinity: God the Father (Ge'ez), the Son (Ezil) and the Holy Spirit (Araray).

1. Ge'ez: is the hard stern, stark and dry. It might be illustrated as commanding, imposing, proclamatory, as elongated reading, as a series of utterances, that are now incantatory and hastily delivered, or suddenly slowly intonated.

2. Ezil: is soft and gentle.  It is naturally sentimental giving sense to Christian teachings of Love. It is tender, mellow and comforting.

3. Araray: is often described as plaintive, approaching too melancholic. It is usually sung2 during gloomy seasons, and remembrance of Lent, especially in Passion Week, or the chant of funeral use this mode. Many labeled its etymology "evoked compassion", "evoked pity", making it plaintive and almost melancholic quality.

CATEGORIES: 2022 EPs, Emo EPs, Punk rock EPs

The Simple Plan is an EP released independently in 2022 by August Is Falling, a pop-punk/emo music project led by American singer-guitarist Pat Finnerty. Music producer Butch Walker mixed the EP's single, "August Is Falling". The EP also features appearances by drummer Eric Slick, Kim, and Toby Leaman of Dr. Dog.

==Development and release==

In mid 2022, Philadelphia-based musician and YouTube personality Pat Finnerty founded August Is Falling, a pop-punk, emo-style music project. Finnerty wrote the songs and played guitars and sang vocals, on the band's The Simple Plan EP that was released independently on September 2, 2022. The EP featured Toby Leaman, Kim, and Butch Walker on tracks, as well an appearance by Eric Slick on drums. Musical artist Harsh Symmetry appeared on EP's the cover. The EP's fifth song track, "August Is Falling", was mixed by acclaimed music producer Butch Walker and released as a single. A lyrics video of the same track was produced by J. Gonzo.

According to Finnerty, the title of the EP spoofs Canadian pop punk band Simple Plan. Lyrics of the songs on the EP take aim at the popular music industry, internet culture, and the state of the emo movement. The EP both lampoons and plays homage to emo/pop-punk bands.

The EP's independent release was backed by a grassroots movement to promote it on YouTube. The single, "August is Falling", garnered 140,000 views on YouTube in its first week after release with August is Falling trending as the Number 1 punk band on BandCamp and the EP being featured on Spotify's new pop punk playlist. 

==Critical reception==

The band and EP received praise from The Darkness front man Justin Hawkins after its release. The website Craig's Music Review rated the EP 8 out of 10. 

Music critic Mark Rowland of Penny Black Music said the EP "sounds like it’s dumbing itself down somewhat to meet the expectations of the genre – to the point of parody in places – but at the same time, the songs are genuinely well constructed and catchy". 

Music commentator Allan Raible of ABC News ranked the EP #45 on his list of the top 50 albums of 2022. Raible said about The Simple Plan EP on the Good Morning America website, "Weirdly, it is supposed to be a joke, but Finnerty is a great musician and songwriter, creating five songs that both lampoon the genre and pay fitting, pitch-perfect, wonderfully immature homage to bands like Blink-182. Armed with skill and heart, this EP is infinitely more than a sarcastic footnote."

Murad Magomedzapirovich Nurmagomedov (Мурад Магомедзапирович Нурмагомедов), known as The Kaspiysk Chikatilo (Каспийск Чикатило), is a Russian serial killer who killed four acquaintances in Moscow Oblast and Dagestan from 2013 to 2016, and remains a suspect in a 2004 murder. Convicted for the latter crimes, he was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.

==Murders==

===Ramazan Kayaev===

On March 15, 2004, Nurmagomedov called over his friend, Ramazan Kayaev, to come over to his house. Accompanied by another friend, Kayaev went and inquired about when he would be repaid for a certain sum of money he had given to Nurmagomedov, to which he replied that he did not have the necessary amount yet. On the following morning, Kayaev received a phone call from his friend and was informed that he had gathered the money. Surprised by this news, he got into his car and drove to Nurmagomedov's house.

As the house passed by, Kayaev's wife and friends began to worry about him and opted to call him on his cellphone, but received no reply. They then submitted a complaint to the local police department which resulted in Nurmagomedov being detained for questioning in the case. During the interrogation, he denied any involvement in Kayaev's disappearance, claiming that he had gone to his house, taken the money and promptly left. Due to the lack of evidence to charge him, Nurmagomedov was released. The department's actions were criticized by Kayaev's family members, especially his mother, all of whom believed that he had been protected by his uncle, Kheyzudin Abdurashidov, a former police officer who was now the head manager of the Municipal Unitary Enterprise "Treatment Facilities". The case eventually went cold, and no new developments would occur for more than a decade.

===Further murders===

In August 2013, Nurmagomedov visited a friend of his, surnamed Chernyshev, at the latter's house in the village of Chelobityevo, Moscow Oblast. For unclear reasons, the pair got into a quarrel that resulted in Nurmagomedov grabbing a nearby knife and stabbing his friend to death. In order to hide the body, he dragged to the nearby road and buried it in a shallow grave.

From August to December 2016, Nurmagomedov treated his home in Kaspiysk as a drug house, where he would sell marijuana and tramadol to friends and acquaintances. On December 6, he had invited an acquaintance surnamed Aduev into the house, but they got into a quarrel that ended with Nurmagomedov beating Aduev to death with a table leg and then burying his body in the yard. Four days later, he repeated this with another friend, Bashirova, whom he also beat to death and then buried her corpse in the yard. His final victim, a neighbor surnamed Aizarov, was lured to the house on December 25 and then hit at least five times on the head with an axe. In this case, Nurmagomedov also stole the victim's car.

==Arrest, trial and imprisonment==

The day after Aizarov's disappearance, Nurmagomedov drove to his father-in-law's house with it, where the car was immediately recognized as belonging to the missing man. As a result, Nurmagomedov was arrested and questioned about the recent killings, with him admitting responsibility for all five of his known murders, including those of Kayaev and Chernyshev. When queried about the Kayaev case, he claimed that he had dismembered the body after killing him, stuffing the head and hands in a barrel while the other remains were put in a bag and dumped near a wastewater treatment plant. Nurmagomedov then showed the authorities where he had dumped Kayaev's remains and that he had sold his car's parts in Manas.

As Kayaev's remains were not found, it was decided that he would not be charged in this case and instead put on trial for the other four murders, in addition to charges of running a drug den and drug trafficking. If convicted, he faced the possibility of a life term. Nurmagomedov would eventually be convicted on all counts, but for reasons unknown, he was given a lesser sentence of 18 years imprisonment, which he has to serve at a corrective labor colony. At present, it is unclear if he will be charged with Kayaev's murder, or if the murder is still under investigation.

[[Pieces of Jade]]

CATEGORIES: 2009 albums, Jazz albums by American artists, Resonance Records albums

Pieces of Jade is a posthumously-released album by jazz bassist Scott LaFaro. It consists of five tracks dating from 1961 featuring LaFaro in a trio format with pianist Don Friedman and drummer Pete La Roca, a 23-minute recording of LaFaro rehearsing with pianist Bill Evans in 1960, a 1966 interview with Evans, and a Friedman solo piano piece dedicated to LaFaro, recorded in 1985. The album was released in 2009 by Resonance Records.

According to Friedman, who briefly roomed with LaFaro in 1957, the recording of the 1961 trio tracks was unplanned: the three musicians happened to be in a studio, and the engineer said "Why don't you guys play and I'll record you." These five tracks were initially released on Friedman's album Memories for Scotty, issued in 1988 by the Japanese label Insights.

2009 also saw the publication of the LaFaro biography Jade Visions, written by the bassist's sister Helene LaFaro-Fernandez, and published by University of North Texas Press as part of their Lives of Musicians Series.

==Reception==

In a review for AllMusic, Michael G. Nastos wrote: "that this recording exists is nothing less than a miracle, and an event in the annals of jazz... It's a rare window into the soul of Scott LaFaro... and a complement to the book written by his sister."

Larry Taylor of All About Jazz stated: "The greatness of LaFaro is reestablished here as he once more excels in the trio format. In this context, it's possible to further appreciate LaFaro's improvisational skill and full bass sound... it's very fortunate to have another recording to add to his legacy." AAJ's Stuart Broomer called the album "a fitting tribute to an essential musician, a complement to the masterpieces LaFaro created with Evans."

Ron Hart, writing for PopMatters, commented: "Pieces of Jade offers a rare glimpse into LaFaro's creative process."

The Absolute Sound's Bill Milkowski praised LaFaro's "melodic ingenuity along with his uncanny speed and facility," and noted that, in the trio pieces, his "ability to spontaneously and effortlessly interject contrapuntal ideas against the flow of each piece marks him as a revolutionary accompanist in a piano trio setting."

In an article for Elsewhere, Graham Reid wrote: "This is classic piano trio jazz... An interesting, valuable and unexpected one from the archives for those deeply into this kind of seminal jazz."

The 1990 Ciskei coup d'état was a bloodless military coup in Ciskei, an unrecognised state and a nominally independent South African homeland for the Xhosa people, which took place on 4 March 1990. The coup was led by the then 37-year-old Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, the Chief of Staff Intelligence of the Ciskei Defence Force, against the government of President for Life Lennox Sebe (CNIP), who was on a state visit to Hong Kong at the time. The coup was followed by widespread rioting and looting, prompting Gqozo to request that the South African government send SADF troops to help restore order.

Subsequently, Gqozo's military government survived several coup attempts, most notably the February 1991 attempt, led by the Chief of the Ciskei Defence Force, Brigadier Andrew Jamangile. Gqozo stayed in power until his resignation in March 1994, several weeks before the reunification of Ciskei with South Africa after the first post-apartheid general election.

[[Reindorf Review]]

CATEGORIES: Freedom of expression in the United Kingdom, Freedom of speech in the United Kingdom, Transgender in the United Kingdom, Academic freedom, University of Essex, 2021 documents

The Reindorf Review was a 2021 article published by the University of Essex and authored by barrister Akua Reindorf surrounding concerns of a suppression of academic freedom due to the de-platforming and blacklisting of academics Jo Phoenix and Rosa Freedman who had expressed "gender critical" views.

The university issued a public apology to both academics and was subject to review their internal policy regarding inviting speakers in the future.

==Background==

On 5 December 2019, Jo Phoenix was invited to the University of Essex to hold a public seminar entitled “Trans rights, imprisonment and the criminal justice system” in which she was scheduled to discuss the possible tensions that would follow from the integration of transgender individuals into single sex prison systems. Backlash followed as credible threats of violence from students and staff accused Phoenix of transphobia. A flyer of a person brandishing a weapon displayed the text "Shut the fuck up, TERF." was posted round the university campus. The initial cancellation of the event was seen to be justified due to security concerns due to the threats of violence. However, following the cancellation, the sociology department blacklisted Phoenix from future talks on concerns of transphobia. This was deemed to be an illegal exercise as it limited Phoenix's freedom of expression. Since the University of Essex is a public authority it has an duty to uphold the right to free expression and thus the blacklisting was not considered to be held on credible grounds. The Reindorf Report states that "The later decision to exclude and blacklist Prof Phoenix was also unlawful. There was no reasonable basis for thinking that Prof Phoenix would engage in harassment or any kind of unlawful speech. The decision was unnecessary and disproportionate. Moreover the violent flyer was wholly unacceptable and should have been the subject of a timely disciplinary investigation."

On 30 January 2020, a roundtable discussion entitled "The State of Antisemitism Today” Rosa Freedman was subject to disinvitation due to 'spurious' and 'non-evidenced' allegations of transphobia. The allegation followed due to concerns over a 2018 open letter by Freedman and 54 other academics on the culture of fear surrounding the conducting of research into transgender issues. This was during a time where changes where being proposed to the Gender Recognition Act which were the topic of debate as it was considered to be a possible conflict towards academic freedom and scientific integrity. Research into transgenderism has been considered to be important as the subject of "no-debate" limits perspectives necessary to provide support to transgender adolescents. The current lack of empirical evidence with which to draw effective support from is said to be dangerous to transgender people and women (who are more often the subject of a disproportionate number allegations of transphobia) as well as emboldening transphobic right-wing ideology as counterarguments are unable to be explored due to pressures to self-censor research proposals. Professor Freedman attended the event on the 30th of January following an internal investigation by the University of Essex who concluded that there were insufficient grounds to bar Freedman from attending the event.

==Aftermath==

Debates on academic freedom have continued with the Reindorf Report being an example of how university institutions prevent research into politically sensitive issues and how this impacts science as a whole. The Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill 2021 and the Higher Education Authority (HEA) Bill 2022 are of particular contemporary interest, cited by supporters as a vital step to ensuring the credible enforcement of free speech on university campuses, while others claim it represents government overreach.

Stonewall, a charity developed following the Stonewall riots of 1969 have begun to be questioned by academics and scholars due to their potentially undemocratic and self-defeating influence in universities due to their continued lobbying efforts which have direct impacts on internal policy within universities. Stonewall has been critiqued for its effective use of 'policy capture' which sees it having disproportionate influence on the legal categories of sex and gender without proper democratic scrutiny

The Free Speech Union has pledged to commit to legal disputes with universities who do not uphold their duties towards freedom of speech.

Malcolm George Neesam (28 June 1946 – 28 June 2022) was an English historian and writer specialising in the history of Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He was also a librarian and archivist. His major works were the first two parts of a projected trilogy on that subject: Harrogate Great Chronicle, 1332–1841 (2005) and Wells and Swells: The Golden Age of Harrogate Spa, 1842–1923 (2022). The third part was to remain unfinished when he died, although his research papers are preserved in the Walker-Neesam Archive at the Mercer Art Gallery, Harrogate.

For his services as a historian, Neesam was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Harrogate by Harrogate Borough Council in 1996, when he was also given honorary membership of The Harrogate Club. He was involved in the inception of the Harrogate Brown Plaque Scheme, and was influential in the listing of many Harrogate buildings. He was a founder member of Harrogate Civic Society and assisted other major local organisations where their work required historical input. For thirty years he wrote the weekly "Bygone Harrogate" column in the Harrogate Advertiser, and his published works spanned a period of fifty years.

==Background==

Malcolm George Neesam was born on 28 June 1946 in a nursing home on Ripon Road, Harrogate, West Riding of Yorkshire. His father worked in a shoe-sole factory. His mother's maiden name was Craggs. He was a pupil at St Peter's Church of England Primary School, and Christ Church Secondary School for Boys (later amalgamated with St Aidan's Church of England High School, Harrogate). Neesam never married. He died of cancer in a Harrogate care home on his 76th birthday in 2022. After his death, Graham Chalmers of the Harrogate Advertiser described him as "Harrogate's greatest historian", and said he had made "a lifetime's contribution to Harrogate's civic life which it is difficult to over-state".

===Personality===

The Stray Ferret said: Unfailingly polite, Neesam was nevertheless often reserved and diffident in public. He rarely talked about his private life but close friends say he had a keen sense of humour, which could border on the macabre at times, and was an excellent cook.

The Harrogate Advertiser said: Deeply committed to the idea of civic pride, generous in his time and supportive of numerous good works in the community over the years, there has scarcely been a signal major public project in Harrogate in recent decades where Malcolm's extensive knowledge of the town's past has not fed into plans for the future in a positive fashion to the benefit of everyone who lives here. More than merely a brilliant historian, Malcolm Neesam throughout his life represented what it means to be a citizen of his town and of his nation in the best possible way with modesty and respect.

Former chairman of Harrogate Civic Society, Henry Pankhurst, said:Neesam was always very well dressed, very precise in language and correct in an old fashioned way. He was immensely gifted and also had an extremely good memory, which proved to be of value as a historian. He was self-sufficient and determined but always appreciative of his friendships and any help he received from anyone.

==Career==

===Employee===

Neesam served three years as a Harrogate Central Library assistant. He then trained and qualified as an archivist and librarian at the University of Leeds. He spent over four years in Hereford setting up a library service for children, then was employed as one of the Duchy of Lancaster's archivists in Northwood, Hillingdon, London. After that he moved back to Harrogate and commuted to York, where he was the York city music librarian until 1974, the year when local government and its employees were reorganised. However the reorganisation made him county music and audiovisiual librarian, overseeing new administration and the development of media from vinyl through cassette tape to compact discs. From 1996 he was arranging vacations for visiting Americans, for the firm Alumni Holidays.

===Historian===

Neesam's literary life began when as a schoolboy he wrote stories. In 1972 he was asked by the Library Association to edit the 16-page booklet Into Space, a "guide to children's sci-fi", which was distributed throughout the libraries of England. While still an employee in York, Neesam was also serving as a tour guide there. With Alumni Holidays he gave lectures on the local environment, literature and architecture. He became a full-time historical author in 2006, and in due course he was termed "chronicler of our town" by Harrogate MP Andrew Jones. As a member of the Harrogate Society, he received requests to write local company histories, and to assist with the creation of commemorative plaques in the town. Neesam wrote a "weekly column in the Harrogate Advertiser running for 30 years on every aspect of the town's heritage".

Neesam's life's work as a historian was his projected trilogy of works on the history of Harrogate. It took him forty years of research and preparation to finally produce the first part in 2005: his weighty 448-page Harrogate Great Chronicle, 1332–1841. The second part was a two-volume set, of 684 and 598 pages respectively. In 2022, when he published it as Wells and Swells: The Golden Age of Harrogate Spa, 1842–1923, The Harrogate Club named its dining room after him. When he died, he was still engaged upon the uncompleted third part, which was intended to encompass Harrogate's history from 1923 onwards. Neesam said of his concentration on Harrogate history: "Some writers can turn to anything. I can only write about things that interest me".

Besides writing, Neesam's historical work included involvement with the listing of various Harrogate buildings, and in the establishment of a conservation area there – the first one in the town. He was also in at the inception of the Harrogate Brown Plaque scheme, when he took part in designing Harrogate's first brown plaque, dedicated to Tewit Well, in 1971. He was still unveiling them in 2022, when the 89th one was installed in honour of The Harrogate Club.

==Institutions and honours==

===Honours===

Neesam was made an honorary member of The Harrogate Club in May 1996, when he was given Freedom of the Borough "for his services as a historian", and "in recognition of his eminence as a local historian and for the help and advice he had given to the Council on a range of matters for many years", by Harrogate Borough Council.

===Harrogate Civic Society===

In 1970 or 1971 Neesam was a founder member of Harrogate Civic Society, then known as the Harrogate Society. Harrogate trader William Woods said:It was Malcolm Neesam, Walter Davey and myself started Harrogate Civic Society in 1970 standing outside Woods shop when we urgently felt the need for a conservation society to primarily stop the five phase traffic management scheme with the last phase including a fly over passing close to the Majestic Hotel.

===Other organisations===

Neesam was associated with the organisation Friends of Valley Gardens, and helped lead the reopening ceremony of the restored Old Magnesia Well Pump Room on 6 October 2015 when it was about to become an information and education centre. He was also associated with the Friends of the Mercer Art Gallery, and gave a talk to that association in 2017, about "Harrogate's connection with the Russian Imperial Family". He was vice president of Harrogate International Festivals, which asked him in 2016 to write the history of its music festival on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, and the finale of the 2022 music festival was dedicated to Neesam. He was involved with Harrogate Theatre and Harrogate Dramatic Society, and assisted in the creation of a new play about Samson Fox: The Man who Captured Sunlight, which was premiered after his death, on 23 September 2022.

==Walker-Neesam Archive==

As of 2022, Neesam's "vast collection of papers and photo library" which "took up an entire room at his home" was to be deposited in the Mercer Art Gallery, Harrogate, as part of the Walker-Neesam Archive. That archive also includes the papers and historical research of Harold Walker, a former editor of the Harrogate Herald.

[[Murthly House]]

CATEGORIES: Castles in Scotland, Demolished buildings and structures in Scotland, Buildings and structures demolished in 1950

Murthly House, also known as  New Murthly Castle, was a substantial mansion in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, designed by James Gillespie Graham and demolished in 1949–50. It was said to be unrivalled in its beauty.

==History==

The house was commissioned by Sir John Archibald Drummond Stuart, 6th Baronet, who selected the eminent Edinburgh architect James Gillespie Graham for the task. The huge size of the house was said to arise from a rivalry with John Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane, who had recently built the huge Taymouth Castle. The house was intended to replace the nearby Murthly Castle, which ironically not only continued to be used, but still exists.

Graham usually worked in a controlled Georgian style, such as his Moray Estate scheme, but chose a highly unconventional Jacobean style, with detailing copied from George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, and was built in a highly ornate and symmetrical fashion, as might have been found in a 17th century Scottish palace. The decorative elements (crests and "buckle quoins") were made in the studio of John Steell. The project began in 1827 as soon as Drummond-Stewart became baronet (on the death of his father), but as the house was never completed it was never wholly occupied, but from 1831 it had a roof and was used for social events such as balls. Other than hosting the marriage of the laird to Jane daughter of the Earl of Moray, when it was perhaps fully occupied, it was never fully used again.

Augustus Pugin, a great admirer of Gillespie Graham, admitted to have been hugely influenced by the design of the house. Pugin became acquainted with Gillespie Graham and the project in 1829 and by 1831 was also involved creating "carvings" for the interior, including a drawing room in the style of Louis XIV (later moved to Murthly Castle).

John, the original laird died childless in Paris on 20 May 1838 and the huge and still unfinished project passed to his younger brother William Drummond Stewart, who had no interest in completing the project, and also inherited huge debts due to the project. More at home in America, where he had been for many years, he introduced American bison to the estate, before returning to America in 1842 once the debts were repaid. Some of the interiors were transferred to Murthly Castle around the time of a fire in 1845.

The house was included in the huge survey of stately homes in Scotland by MacGibbon & Ross in 1892.

The final laird was D. Stewart Fotheringham who saw the building as a burden and foolish decision of his ancestors. Demolition was proposed in October 1948 and began in 1949. The 200,000 tons of stone realised were partly used to build workers' housing (35 houses) at the nearby Pitlochry Hydro-electric scheme, plus a further 29 houses at Tarbet, but the rubble was largely as ballast for the dam associated with the scheme. Some of the larger blocks were used to repair the Dunkeld Bridge over the River Tay in Dunkeld.

Demolition was undertaken by the Dundee contractor, Charles Brand, who made a full photographic record of the progress.

The pitch pine roof beams were one of the few elements to be salvaged. Once the roof was removed (to extract organic material) the walls were destroyed by controlled explosions, overseen by David Faulds, an explosives expert from ICI's explosives section based at Ardeer who had been previously involved in major projects such as the destruction of The Crystal Palace. The final element removed was the huge central tower.

A collection of architectural drawings from the house were donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum and exhibited in May 1981.

[[Queensbridge Collective]]

CATEGORIES: Proposed buildings and structures in the United States, Buildings and structures in Charlotte, North Carolina

Queensbridge Collective, formerly known as 1111 South Tryon, is a two-building development under construction in South End neighborhood in Charlotte, North Carolina.  It broke ground in May 2023.

==Site History==

The Uptown Cabaret's building, which formerly occupied the site, was built in 1929 according to a fire insurance map from that time.  Then in 1934 it became an antique store until 1954 when the store moved another location.  In 1956 business owner E.B. Stone renovated the building and moved his company into the second floor.  At its peak occupancy 100 people employed by E.B. Stone Finance Co. worked out of the building.  In 1984 E.B. Stone Finance Co. dissolved.  From 1956 to 1984 a variety of businesses also occupied the building.  Then in 1995 Daniel Seeman and his business partner, Brian Dominick, opened a strip club in the building.

Brian Dominick was the previous owner of the site prior to Riverside.  His ownership began in 1995 when he purchased the building of the Uptown Cabaret located at 112 East Morehead to convert it to a strip club.  Previously the building was a two-story office building. The club was originally called The Dollhouse.

The 1.1-acre lot of the Ascot Inn, which was built in 1963, was purchased by Dominick for $3.14 million in August 2004, it was previously owned by Boone-based Oscar Investors Management. In December 2004 Brian Dominick and Tom Wicker paid $613,000 for an 11,000 parcel that was a former car lot, which gave them control of the entire block.  In July 2007 it was announced that the Uptown Cabaret was under consideration as a possible location for a condo development built by Raleigh based developer Lichtin.  Dominick confirmed this inquiry.  However, he did not express that the development was a serious possibility.  In August 2011 Brian Dominick and his investment group demolished the Ascot Inn, located on South Tryon near the Midnight Diner.  At that time Dominick vaguely alluded to plans for a future development.

The Midnight Diner was originally located in Kings Mountain, North Carolina.  In April 2010 Brian Dominick purchased it.  He brought in an independent contractor to run the diner and lease the land.  Upon opening it featured 24 hours a day service and a chicken dinner only second to Price's Chicken Coop, which operated on Camden Rd in South End for 60 years.  However, it closed in June 2021 to make way for a 30-story residential tower.

==Development History==

Chicago developer Riverside Investment & Development Co. in December 2021 paid $35 million for the 2.75 site consisting of seven parcels that was occupied by Midnight Diner and Uptown Cabaret at West Morehead and South Tryon streets, around the same time it was announced the diner would relocate.  During the planning stages there was no word of the Uptown Cabaret opening in another location.

The original plans called for three towers for a project cost of $750 million. It is designed to link the growing South End neighborhood with Uptown Charlotte, which is why the name Queensbridge Collective was chosen.    The name change was revealed in March 2022. Three buildings included a 42-story office tower with 750,000 of space, a 38-story apartment tower with 350 units, and a 30-story apartment tower with 300 units.

In August 2022, the Midnight Diner announced it would close on September 5, 2022, to have the building moved to 420 E Trade Street. The Trade St site was a surface parking lot prior to the relocation of the Midnight Diner. It was announced that it would take 10 to 14 days to prepare the diner for transport and 45 to 60 days for construction at the new site.  At 1:30 AM on November 2, 2022 the Midnight Diner was towed by a large truck from 115 E. Carson St. to 420 E. Trade.  The mile journey took 90 minutes.  The entrance to the diner will be moved by a crane within a week, after the building is secure on its new foundation.

In September 2022, Riverside announced that the development has been changed to consist of 2 buildings instead of 3. The 42-story office building remained unchanged however the 2-apartment towers were merged into 1 larger building.  The residential tower will be 45 stories and contain 400 units.  After announcing the 3 buildings in March 2022 a geological survey revealed the site water table was higher than originally thought.  Therefore, eliminating 1 of the 2 residential towers allowed an above ground parking structure to be created.  The parking structure will be on stories 2 through 9 and consist of 2,000 spots.

Part of the new development will be road improvements. Riverside worked with Charlotte's transportation and planning departments to determine the best improvements.  Morehead Square Drive, South Tryon, East Morehead St, and East Carson will be widened.  Also, new bike lanes and pedestrian crossings, along with a connection to the Carson Boulevard light rail stop, will be added.  Also, the College Street Connector will be destroyed, it's possible a new connector will be created.

On May 16, 2023 it was announced that Riverside Investment & Development Co. had scheduled May 24 as the development ground breaking ceremony.  The residential tower began site work after the ground breaking ceremony.  However, the office tower will not break ground until at least July after the Uptown Cabaret closes in late June and is demolished.  Ultimately, commercial real estate markets conditions will govern when the office tower begins construction.

CATEGORIES: Surnames of Filipino origin

Tolentino is a Spanish surname. Notable people with the surname include:

[[Trachyaretaon echinatus]]

CATEGORIES: Phasmatodea, Phasmatodea of Asia, Insects described in 1877

Trachyaretaon echinatus is a species of the order of the stick insects native to various Philippine islands.

==Characteristics==

The females of Trachyaretaon echinatus reach lengths of 77. Males grow up to 55 long. The lively green-brown to black-brown and very variable coloring can be dominated by dark green tones in the females. In addition to black areas on the front segments of the abdomen, they can also have white bands on the femurs or a white triangle on the pronotum. They are morphologically similar to those of the slightly smaller Trachyaretaon gatla, in which the supraanal plate (epiproct), i.e. the eleventh tergite, as well as the seventh sternite of the abdomen is clearly notched, while in the females of Trachyaretaon echinatus it ends rounded or truncated. The abdominal tergites two to seven are almost twice as wide as long, the tergites six to nine are smooth or indistinctly keeled, unlike in Trachyaretaon gatla. Compared to the significantly larger and less spined Trachyaretaon carmelae, the tiny spines between the large teeth on the ventral carina of the meso- and metafemurs are missing in both sexes.

==Distribution and Way of life==

While only the Philippines are mentioned as the original locality, subsequent works specify this and name the islands of Sibuyan, Masbate and Luzon as the distribution area. Manila, Banahao and Marinfata are mentioned as localities on Luzon. Mango and guava are known to be food plants for Trachyaretaon echinatus. Since both crops are in the range of the species, it is sometimes considered a pest species there.

==Taxonomy==

Carl Stål described the species in 1877 under the basionym Obrimus echinatus using a 77 long female, which is deposited as a holotype in the Naturhistoriska riksmuseet in Stockholm. The species name "echinatus" refers to the prickly body surface (ancient Greek echínos (ἐχῖνος) for Sea urchins (Echinoidea)). In 1939 James Abram Garfield Rehn and his son John W. H. Rehn described the genus Aretaon with the subgenera Aretaon and Trachyaretaon. In the subgenus Trachyaretaon she transferred as the only species Obrimus echinatus, which was thus referred to as Aretaon (Trachyaretaon) echinatus. In 2004, Oliver Zompro elevated this subgenus to the rank of a genus, the type species of which is Trachyaretaon echinatus.

==In terraristics==

Since around 2010/2011, a sexual breeding stock has been found in the terrariums of lovers, which goes back to specimens collected in 2009 by Joachim Bresseel on Luzon in the province of Aurora near the city of San Luis at the Cunayan and Ditumabo waterfalls. It was first referred to as Trachyaretaon echinatus, but was not considered to belong to this species shortly after breeding was established. Since then, this stock is known under the name Trachyaretaon sp. 'Aurora'. The Phasmid Study Group lists it under the PSG number 317. Shortly after the introduction of Trachyaretaon sp. 'Aurora' the first specimens actually identified as Trachyaretaon echinatus came alive to Europe. The stock, which is also sexual, goes back to animals collected in Marinfata on Luzon. In contrast to Trachyaretaon sp. 'Aurora' this species got the PSG number 326 from the Phasmid Study Group.

Keeping and breeding is considered easy. A wide variety of forage plants such as bramble, hazel, firethorn and ivy are eaten. Moderately moist terrariums with substrate for laying eggs are required for breeding.

[[Object 277]]

CATEGORIES: Cold War tanks of the Soviet Union, Heavy tanks of the Soviet Union, Trial and research tanks of the Soviet Union, Abandoned military projects of the Soviet Union, Kirov Plant products

The Object 277 (Объект 277) was a prototype Soviet heavy tank designed in 1957, one of the last heavy tanks to be produced by the USSR. Developed alongside its sister design, the Object 278, as well as the Object 279 and the Object 770, Object 277 was a conventional heavy tank, armed with a powerful gun and thickly armoured. All development was cancelled in 1960, as part of Nikita Khrushchev's wish to abandon what he deemed obsolete heavy tanks, and re-focus efforts on ATGMs.

==History==

In 1956, the GBTU (main armour directorate of the USSR) laid out the tactical and technical requirements for a new heavy tank. 3 projects would eventually emerge from this decree: the Object 277, 279 and 770. Object 277 and 279 were developed at OKBT (LKZ), the Leningrad Special-purpose Design Bureau (SKB), and Object 770 at Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. Despite having wildly different designs, the 3 vehicles were to share the 130mm M-65. Object 279's development was headed by L.S. Troyanov, Object 770's by Pavel Isakov, and Object 277's by Josef Kotin.

==Development==

Development of the Object 277 began in 1956. From the beginning, there were to be two vehicles: Object 277 and Object 278, different in design. However, the two design groups led by N.F. Shashmurin and N.M. Chistyakov decided to unify the layout of their designs, instead varying only in the engine. In December 1958, the first prototype of the Object 277 was manufactured, and sent to testing. The second prototype was also produced during this time, and both were tested from January 7, 1959 until February 26, 1960. A separate turret and hull were also produced for firing tests.

Testing revealed the Object 277 was inferior to the Object 770. Subsequently, work on the 277 was cancelled following the Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on July 19, 1960. 3 days later, on July 22, 1960, Khrushchev forbade the further development of any tanks with a weight of over 37 tons. This halted the development of all 3 of the vehicles, and with a new focus on MBTs and ATGMs, consigned heavy tanks to history.

==Design==

The Object 277 was a standard heavy tank design. The hull was based on the T-10M, but elongated and more curved. The 277 carried the 130mm M-65 cannon. The gun was stabilised with the "Groza" system and was attached to a TPDS stereoscopic rangefinder sight. The gun was loaded with the help of an assisted loading mechanism, as the shells were too heavy to be safely and quickly loaded solely by manpower (30.7 kg). The 30.7 kg armour-piercing ammunition could be fired at 1050 m/s, and penetrated 280mm of vertical steel at 1000m. APDS ammunition (8.7 kg in weight) could be fired at 1800 m/s, and penetrated 350mm of vertical steel at 1000m. The cannon could elevate and depress to +16° and -5° respectively.

The Object 277 had impressive armour characteristics: the cast turret varied from 290mm to 139mm, at angles from 30° to 55° from the vertical. The hull was around 140mm thick, and the sloped sides around 112mm. During testing, the armour withstood close-range shots from the 122mm D-25T. The vehicle was also equipped with an anti-nuclear protection system and thermal smoke equipment.

The engine used was the M-850 diesel engine, an upgraded version of the B-2 diesel engine, producing a horsepower of 1090. Despite the tank's weight of 55 tons, the engine and transmission could propel the vehicle to a maximum speed of 55 km/h.

==Variants==

During development, a separate vehicle was designed with a new engine in mind. The Object 278 was in all other ways identical to the Object 277, but housed the experimental GTD-1 gas turbine engine, as well as a planetary gearbox. The vehicle never left the blueprint stage, and development was cancelled on July 19, 1960, along with the Object 277.

The Faculty of Law (Facultad de Derecho) is a faculty of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), the largest university in Argentina. It was founded alongside the university in 1821, and has consistently remained one of its largest constituent schools, presently counting with 23,790 enrolled graduate students. At the graduate level, it offers law degrees as well as public translation and forensic calligraphy degrees, in addition to the professorship on judicial sciences.

Among its alumni, the UBA Faculty of Law counts sixteen Argentine presidents, as well as one of Argentina's five Nobel Prize laureates, Carlos Saavedra Lamas.

The faculty has its seat at a Neoclassical complex on Avenida Figueroa Alcorta, in the Recoleta district of Buenos Aires. The building was inaugurated in 1949, and has become a landmark of the city. It is served by the Buenos Aires Underground through Facultad de Derecho station of Line H.

==Degrees==

The faculty offers four degrees at the graduate level: law degrees (abogacía), legal translation, public (forensic) calligraphy, and the professorship of judicial sciences. Law degrees count with a Ciclo Profesional Común (CPC, "common professional cycle") and a Ciclo Profesional Orientado (CPO, "oriented professional cycle"). The CPC makes up the better part of the degree's course, with fourteen mandatory subjects. Once completed, a law student is given the title of "University Bachelor in Law" (Bachiller Universitario en Derecho). The CPO specializes law students in a specific field of law: public law (either administrative law or international public law, or both), private law, criminal law, corporate law, labor and social security law, tax law, and notary law.

On legal translation, the faculty offers degrees on English, German, French, Italian and Portuguese translation, in addition to "non-regular" languages of the student's choosing, granted there are available professors at the time.

In addition, the faculty offers a number of specialization degrees, as well as magister degrees, doctorates and post-doctoral degrees in diverse fields.

==Political and institutional life==

Like the rest of the University of Buenos Aires's faculties, the UBA Faculty of Law operates under the principle of tripartite co-governance, wherein authorities are democratically elected and professors, students and graduates are represented in the faculty's governing bodies. The faculty is headed by a Dean (decano or decana), who presides over the Directive Council (Consejo Directivo). The Directive Council is made up of eight representatives for the professors, four representatives of the student body, and four representatives of the faculty's graduates. Deans are elected by the Directive Council every four years, while elections to the council take place every two years.

Since 2022, the dean of the Faculty of Law has been Dr. Leandro Vergara, with Dr. Silvia Nonna as vice dean.

==Notable alumni==

Out of the seventeen Argentine presidents who have attended the University of Buenos Aires, sixteen studied at the Faculty of Law: Carlos Pellegrini, Luis Sáenz Peña, José Evaristo Uriburu, Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña, Victorino de la Plaza, Hipólito Yrigoyen, Marcelo T. de Alvear, Roberto Ortiz, Ramón Castillo, Arturo Frondizi, Raúl Alfonsín, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Eduardo Duhalde, and Alberto Fernández. Quintana also served as rector of the university, while Alberto Fernández taught courses on criminal law at the graduate level for many years before being elected to the presidency.

The Faculty of Law also educated Carlos Saavedra Lamas, a jurist, diplomat and politician who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1936 due to his efforts in ceasing hostilities during the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay; Saavedra Lamas was the first Latin American Nobel Peace Prize laureate. He eventually became rector of the University of Buenos Aires in 1941.

A number of relevant jurists have earned their law degrees at the UBA Faculty of Law. Luis Moreno Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, earned his degree in 1978. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda judge Inés Mónica Weinberg de Roca is also a UBA alumna and former faculty, having taught courses on International Private Law from 2001. Several ministers of the Supreme Court of Argentina are UBA alumni as well, such as Enrique S. Petracchi, Carlos Fayt, Carmen Argibay, Elena Highton de Nolasco, and Carlos Rosenkrantz. Prominent legal philosopher Eugenio Bulygin earned his law degree and his PhD at the UBA Faculty of Law, where he also taught throughout his career. Teodosio César Brea, founder of the prominent Allende & Brea law firm, graduated UBA and taught courses at the Faculty of Law as well. Valeria Vegh Weis, criminologist, criminal attorney, and university professor, was also educated at UBA.

The Adat People's Movement (Narodnoye dvizheniye «Adat»; «Ӏадат» халкъан болам) is a Chechen opposition movement founded in 2020 and led by Ibragim Yangulbaev.

The movement gained fame thanks to the Telegram channel, the authors of which criticize the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. Adat claims to be in favour of "an end to the genocide of the Chechen people, the unification of the Chechen people and the de-occupation of Chechnya."

The materials of this telegram channel were termed by the Russian court as extremist and the entire movement is designated as an extremist entity in Russia.

==History==

The movement was founded in April 2020 initially as a Telegram channel. Its leader is Ibragim Yangulbaev (born in 1995) of the Yangulbaev family. His father Saidi Yangulbaev is a well-known former judge in the republic who left the country in early 2022 after the arrest of his wife Zarema Musayeva.

On 31 January 2022, the Grozny Court put Ibragim Yangulbaev on the wanted list. On 12 May 2022, the telegram channel "1ADAT", associated with the movement, was recognized as extremist by the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic. Earlier, at the suit of the prosecutor's office, publications in the telegram channel of the movement were recognized as extremist. On 11 July 2022, the movement was included in the list of banned organizations by the Russian Ministry of Justice. Soon the movement was added to the Federal List of Extremist Organizations at number 92.

Threats against the Yangulbaev family were made by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. He called the family "accomplices of terrorists" and called on them to detain, and in case of resistance – to "assassinate".

In August 2022, it was reported that Salman Tepsurkayev, moderator of the movement's telegram channel, was killed by Kadyrov's security services.

After the announcement of the mobilization in Russia, the movement stated that its human rights activists had already received many complaints about the abductions of men in Chechnya and threats to send them to Ukraine.

The Russian propaganda company Internet Research Agency called the Adat movement a project of the West, the main goal of which is to discredit Chechnya and Russia.

[[If You Go Down (I'm Goin' Down Too)]]

CATEGORIES: 2022 singles, 2022 songs, Kelsea Ballerini songs, American country music songs, Black River Entertainment singles, Songs written by Kelsea Ballerini, Songs written by Shane McAnally, Song recordings produced by Shane McAnally

"If You Go Down (I'm Goin' Down Too)" is a song recorded by American country music artist Kelsea Ballerini. It was released to country music radio on December 5, 2022, as the second single from Ballerini's fourth studio album, Subject to Change. It was written by Ballerini, Shane McAnally and Julian Bunetta, with the latter two also producing the track. Lyrically, the song is about a supportive female friendship, with Ballerini noting that she will stick with her friend through whatever trouble she ends up getting into.

==Content==

The song was the final one written for Subject to Change, as the majority of the album had already been cut. Ballerini and her collaborators decided to book one final writing day in case they had anything left in the tank and, when reviewing the topics covered by the songs on the album, realized there wasn't one that honored her friendships. Of this, Ballerini explained, "friends was a huge theme on my last record - the two lyrics that popped up the most on that Kelsea record were 'home' and 'friends, and so it was like I was doing a disservice to a pillar in my life to not have a song that carried that through." Speaking to Billboard, Ballerini stated that the song was written to evoke thoughts of the 1991 film Thelma & Louise and The Chicks' "Goodbye Earl", noting that “these really beautiful best-friend stories that had a tinge of murder attached” helped to inspire the song. Buetta, in turn, composed an upbeat, cheery melody and instrumentation on his guitarlele to contrast with the darkly comedic lyrics. Similarly, Ballerini took roughly two hours to record her vocals and was careful to ensure that the song's tongue-and-cheek message was conveyed effectively.

Sonically the song reflects the country pop and neotraditional country styles, with Ballerini explaining that “we really wanted to lean into a very ’90s country feel, and so we brought in fiddle for the song, which I think to me makes it. That’s also why there’s a Chicks reference to it, which everyone picks up on, which was absolutely intentional. I didn’t want to make it sound like anything else on the record. I wanted it to be its own moment.”"

In interviews, Ballerini discussed the song's significance in her personal life at the time, citing that her female friends were vital while she was going through her divorce from Morgan Evans, stating “sometimes you put out a single because you think that it's the most radio-friendly, and sometimes you put out a single because it's actually reflective of where you're at in your life," she said. "And then sometimes, both things can be true.”

==Music videos==

The song's concept video premiered on September 16, 2022 and features Ballerini in a pastel-colored room engaging in various activities such as applying make-up, reading a book, calling a friend, cleaning and drinking wine, seemingly unfazed as the weather outside slowly worsens, ending with hurricanes, explosions and thunder and lightning.

The official music video was released on March 31, 2023.

==Live performances==

Ballerini performed an acoustic version of the song live on her episode of CMT Storytellers, which aired on February 16, 2023. Ballerini included the song as part of the setlist of her 2022–2023 Heartfirst Tour. Ballerini performed the song at the 2023 CMT Music Awards accompanied by RuPaul's Drag Race stars Manila Luzon, Kennedy Davenport, Jan Sport and Olivia Lux.

Adrian A. Veideman is a Canadian former professional ice hockey Defenseman. He won two National Championships with Denver in 2004 and 2005 as well as Austrian and Norwegian league championships.

==Career==

Veideman was a high-scoring defenseman for his junior team, the Salmon Arm Silverbacks. He averaged exactly a point per game over two seasons before making the jump to the college ranks with Denver. His offensive output decreased significantly with the Pioneers but Veideman was still a major contributor on defense. He helped Denver win the national championship as a freshman and then repeat the following year. Though Denver missed the tournament in his final two seasons with the program, Veideman served as team captain during his senior season and led them to a winning record.

After graduating with a bachelor's in finance/real estate, Veideman began his professional career with the Augusta Lynx. His scoring from juniors returned in force and he appeared in both the ECHL All-Star Game and on the ECHL All-Rookie Team. While he received a brief callup during the year, it wasn't until 2009 that he got a good shot at the AHL. He performed well during the year but found himself in his third organization the following year. Veideman's stop in Peoria did not turn out well and after just 1 point in 14 games he left the team.

Veideman travelled to Germany and joined the Iserlohn Roosters midway through the year. He played well enough to earn an extension and remained with the club through the end of the 2011 season. Unfortunately, Iserlohn missed the postseason both years and allowed Veideman to leave afterwards. The following year saw Veideman join Black Wings Linz and help the team win both the regular season and postseason titles. With his first league championship in his back pocket, Veideman changed teams again but remained in Austria. Though his offense declined, he helped the Vienna Capitals win a regular season title and then finish as the postseason runners-up. A second regular season title the following year ended with a knockout in the quarterfinals and Veideman was once again on the move. He spent all of the 2015 season with the Stavanger Oilers and helped the club win both league championships. With his playing career winding down, Veideman returned to North America and spent one year with the Colorado Eagles. He led the team in scoring by defensemen and helped the Eagles win the regular season championship and was named a first team all-star. After the team lost in the first round of the playoffs, Veideman retired as a player.

With his playing days behind him, Veideman remained in the area and began working as a real estate agent. While continuing in that role, he could not stay away from hockey and began working as an assistant coach in the local youth league. In 2018 he joined the staff at Valor Christian High where he remains as of 2022.

Hannah Collins (born May 6, 1997), professionally known as Scene Queen and formerly RØSÉ, is an American singer and songwriter signed to Hopeless Records. She is known for coining the style "Bimbocore", a subgenre of metalcore with feminist themes. She rose to fame on the social media platform TikTok, where she has garnered over 230,000 followers as of April 2022. Her debut EP Bimbocore was released on April 29, 2022. A followup EP, Bimbocore Vol. 2, was released on November 10, 2022.

==Early life and career==

Hannah Collins grew up in Upstate New York and has lived in Alabama, Ohio, and currently lives in Los Angeles, California. Growing up, she and her older sister listened to emo bands such as My Chemical Romance and Brand New. In middle school, she ran a Tumblr blog and was a fan of scene bands such as Sleeping With Sirens, Pierce The Veil and indie-pop bands such as The Ready Set. She originally intended to work on the administrative side of the music industry, hoping to land a job at Hopeless Records but decided against it. She left the scene movement in 2015 after feeling it had become misogynistic, focusing her songwriting on Pop, Hip-hop and Latin world but returned to the Alt movement where she encompassed all these genres into her music. She applied for internships at Hopeless Records 3 times.

She self-released the single "Are You Tired?" in 2020, and signed with Hopeless Records in 2021. On March 3, 2022, Scene Queen released the song "Pink Rover", a song about the objectification of women and street harassment. On April 19, 2022, she announced that her debut EP Bimbocore would be released on April 29, 2022, alongside the single "Pink Panther".

Of her creative process, she said "Before writing Bimbocore I felt like if I wasn’t exactly the way the rock industry wanted me to be I would never make it. It’s through this project that I’ve been able to pull myself out of that space and be unapologetically myself. I wrote this EP to be hyper-feminine and over the top because women have spent far too long making themselves small for other people's comfort. I realized that the louder I am and the more out of the box I get, the bigger the box gets, and the more room there is for other women to get inside it."

On July 15, 2022, Scene Queen released the lead single from her second EP, "Pink G-String". The EP's second single, "Barbie & Ken", is a collaboration with American punk band Set It Off. The song was released on August 25, 2022. Scene Queen's second EP, titled Bimbocore Vol. 2, was released on November 10, 2022, along with the single "Pink Hotel". Scene Queen's debut full-length album will be released in 2023.

==Musical style==

Scene Queen defines her music as "bimbocore", a subgenre of metalcore, alternative rock and pop that "blends the reclaimed hyperfeminine aesthetics and vocal distortions of genres like pop with metalcore-inspired breakdowns". Her music has been described by Kerrang! as "a jagged jigsaw of clashing sounds, combining ferocious walls of djent guitar, and thumping trap beats that come together to create a seething harshness that will draw in fans of everyone from Ghostemane to Ashnikko and Kesha."

Her song "Pretty in Pink" blends screamo vocals with nursery rhyme melodies, while "Pink Panther" is an alt-pop track that samples "The Pink Panther Theme" with lyrics about girl-on-girl lust. Her fashion style is inspired by Y2K fashion style icons like Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie, with blonde hair and hot pink clothes.

==Personal life==

Collins has ADHD and bipolar disorder. She is bisexual and has said that her song "Pink Panther", which features themes of attraction to women, helped her come out.

Cicero Jefferson Lindly (1857―1926) was an American politician and judge who served as a Republican member of the Illinois House of Representatives.

==Biographical sketch==

Cicero Jefferson Lindly was born near St. Jacob, Illinois on December 11, 1857. Raised in Southern Illinois, he attended McKendree University where he eventually received a Bachelor of Laws. He was married December 22, 1880, to Alice J. McNeil, of Greenville, Illinois. That same year, Lindly purchased a section of land near Greenville and settled in Bond County. In the 1884 presidential election, Lindly was a presidential elector for Republicans James G. Blaine and John A. Logan. In 1886, Lindly was elected county judge in Bond County. Two years later, he was a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention. In that year's election, Landly was a staunch advocate of fellow Illinoisan Shelby Moore Cullom's candidacy for the Republican nomination until the latter dropped out and supported Benjamin Harrison.

In 1890, he was the Republican nominee for both Illinois Treasurer and a seat in the United States House of Representatives. He also became the president of the Farmers' Mutual Benefit Association. In the 1891 United States Senate election, he was a compromise candidate to try and win over the three representatives of the Farmers' Alliance. Ultimately, two of the Farmers' Alliance legislators opted for Democratic nominee John M. Palmer.

In 1897, Governor John Riley Tanner appointed Lindly to be Chairman of the Railroad and Warehouse Commission. While chairman of that commission, he was selected to be president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners from May 1898 to February 1902. In 1900, he moved to Greenville. He served in the Illinois House of Representatives as one of three representatives from the 47th district during the 43rd, 44th, and 45th General Assemblies. In 1913 he was appointed Master in Chancery of Bond County. He was a delegate to the 1916 Republican National Convention and served for a period on the Central Committee of the Illinois Republican Party. He was elected a delegate to the 1920 Illinois Constitutional Convention from the 47th district. In 1921, Governor Len Small appointed Lindly to the Illinois Commerce Commission, a position in which Lindly would serve for the rest of his life. He died at his home in Greenville in 1926.

2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine

200+ (26 September)

With the beginning of mobilization in Russia, anti-war and anti-mobilization protests broke out in Chechnya, Dagestan and other regions of the Russian Caucasus. 

On 25 September, mass protests took place in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, which ended in fights with the police and dispersal.

==History==

===21–22 September===

On 21 September, in the capital of Chechnya, Grozny, on the day the mobilization was announced in Russia, several dozen women tried to hold a protest rally against it. All of them were detained. The action provoked an angry reaction from the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.

The next day, in Babayurt, the Republic of Dagestan, the federal highway was blocked at the exit from the village. Also, a group of villagers gathered near the local military registration and enlistment office, where there was a clash between them and an employee of the military registration and enlistment office.

The same day, women also protested in Baksan, Kabardino-Balkaria. They were crying and screaming.

===25–26 September===

====Endirey====

On 25 September, residents of Endirey, Khasavyurtovsky District of Dagestan, took part in a rally against mobilization and blocked the Khasavyurt-Makhachkala federal highway. The reason for the protest was the mass mobilization, and not the partial mobilization promised by President Putin. It was planned to mobilize 110 people from a village with a population of 8,000, including those who had recently returned from the army.

The security forces fired into the air to stop the rally. About a hundred people gathered. After the speech of the military commissar, the protesters dispersed.

====Nalchik====

On the same day, a protest action - also with the participation of primarily women - was held in the Circassian-majority city of Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria. Five Circassian nationalists, Valery Khazhukov, Marks Shakhmurov, Aslan Beshto, Alik Shashev and Timur Alo issued a 1,250-word letter to the heads of the local republics to stop mobilization. Several dozens of local residents took to the rally in front of the government building. A rally was held, the following day. The protesters were joined by local officials. They refused to answer questions about how many people would be mobilized from the republic.

====Makhachkala====

The Telegram channels Morning Dagestan and 1ADAT acted as the initiators and coordinators of the rallies.

On the afternoon of September 25, people, mostly women, gathered for a protest in the center of Makhachkala. The protesters chanted "No to war!", "No mobilization" and "Our children are not fertilizer!" When up to several protesters gathered at a rally near the Puppet Theater, the police began arrests.

According to eyewitnesses, stun guns and peppercorns were used during the arrest, protesters, including women, were beaten with batons and shot into the air. According to OVD-Info, at least 101 people were arrested. The administrator of the telegram channel "Basement of Dagestan", which broadcast the events at the rally, was searched.

The events were covered by the journalists of the Chernovik newspaper, they reported on the obstruction of journalistic activities by the security forces. The Caucasian Knot correspondent was detained.

To calm the protesters, the Dagestan military commissar announced that people who do not have military experience, as well as conscripts, are not subject to conscription. He also called the rumors about 13,000 people subject to conscription in the republic false. Against the backdrop of protests, the head of Dagestan, Sergey Melikov, announced the mistakes made during mobilization activities, the next day he promised to personally check the mobilization points. He also called the organizers "evil" The head of the Ministry of Youth of the Republic of Dagestan Kamil Saidov spoke about the paid shares by the West. The mayor of Makhachkala called the protest an attempt to disrupt the Day of the City of Makhachkala, which took place in parallel with the rally.

By the end of the day, the protest was dispersed by Rosgvardia troops. OVD-Info, following the results of the action reported "very tough" detentions.

Shortly after the dispersal of protests in Dagestan, the organizers decided to organize a partisan movement. According to the organizers of the partisan movement, "as early as 26 September, everyone will see their plan." At night, the organizers announced an ultimatum demanding the release of all detainees, otherwise they threatened to block federal highways in the republic and stop railway communication.

The following day, from 15:00 local time, people began to gather on the central square of Makhachkala. Soon, a mass brawl between protesters and police began on the central square. It is known about 110 detainees.

The square was cordoned off by the police and the National Guard from the very beginning. Eyewitnesses reported that security forces were beating protesters, while National Guard officers also threatened journalists and demanded that the video of the arrests be removed. The security forces also used tear gas against the protesters.

====Nartkala====

On 26 September, protests were reported in the Circassian town of Nartkala and photographs were published.

====Khasavyurt====

On the same day, in the city of Khasavyurt, about a hundred people came out to protest. There were skirmishes between the security forces and the protesters. The police carried out harsh arrests of protesters.

===30 September===

Protest actions were announced in Makhachkala and other cities of Dagestan on 30 September. On the morning of September 30, there were reports that the FSB had detained some administrators and members of telegram channels that published calls for rallies. In the pro-government media, such telegram channels were called “created as part of the information and subversive action of the CIPSO GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine under the patronage of the US CIA”.

====Makhachkala====

According to Kavkaz.Realii, policemen set up barriers in the central square of the city, and an increased presence of law enforcement officers was observed around the square.

There was also a cluster of police near some mosques in the city. Most likely, law enforcement agencies were afraid that after Friday prayers, parishioners would go to demonstrations.

Senior students in six schools in Makhachkala, located in the center or close to it, were kept at school until 6-7 pm, extending the school day. At the same time, there were schools where classes were held as usual.

==Cases against detainees==

On 27 September, the press secretary of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ravina Shamdasani, called on the Russian authorities to release the Russians detained for the protests, highlighting the situation in Dagestan. It was stated: "We emphasize that the arrest of people solely for exercising their right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression constitutes arbitrary deprivation of liberty."

As of 28 September, 30 criminal cases have been initiated in Dagestan against those detained at the protests. Some of the cases are being handled by human rights activists from OVD-Info, lawyers report that all the defendants have bodily injuries. Lawyer Nadezhda Borodkina, who is in charge of 4 cases, said that the detainees were tortured in police departments.

==Reactions==

On 23 September, the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, stated that mobilization in the region was cancelled.

On 25 September, the head of Dagestan, Sergey Melikov, stated that "a number of mistakes were made in the course of partial mobilization in the constituent entities of Russia." He asked for residents to report violations of citizens' legal rights and claimed that all the incidents would be investigated.

During the rallies on 25 September, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued an appeal to Dagestanis supporting the protest and urging them to resist the mobilization.

On 26 September, the head of Dagestan stated that "The protests in Makhachkala were controlled from abroad".

[[Edén Muñoz]]

CATEGORIES: 1990 births, Living people, Mexican male singer-songwriters, Mexican singer-songwriters

Rodolfo Edén Muñoz Cantú, better known as Edén Muñoz (eˈðem muˈɲos)

(born September 25, 1990), is a Mexican singer, songwriter and producer of Regional Mexican music.

==Biography==

Muñoz is the youngest of four siblings born to Rodolfo Muñoz and Isidora Cantú. As a young child, Muñoz and his family moved from Los Mochis, Sinaloa to Mazatlán.

Edén's older brother Daniel gave him guitar lessons when Edén was eight and he quickly learned how to play it.

After several years of playing music in family gatherings, local bands, festivals, and restaurants, in 2006 Muñoz was given the opportunity to formally join a professional band. He became a vocalist and guitarist for the band Colmillo Norteño, which after ten years of being founded and playing traditional Norteño music, they changed their style to what is now known as Norteño-Banda, a combination between Norteño and Banda music. While in the band, Muñoz learned to play the diatonic button accordion and became the band's lead vocalist. He also wrote some songs for the band.

In early 2010, due to differences with the other members of the band, Muñoz left Colmillo Norteño and formed his own group with the same Norteño-Banda concept and was called Puro Colmillo Norteño. To avoid legal conflicts, the new band's name was changed to Calibre 50.

Between 2010 and 2022, Muñoz was the leader, main songwriter, main producer, vocalist, and accordionist for Calibre 50. With the band, Muñoz managed to obtain the record for the most songs that would reach No. 1 for a Regional Mexican band or solo artist on Billboard.

Muñoz has also been a songwriter of several hits for other Regional Mexican acts.

In early 2022, Muñoz left Calibre 50 to pursue a solo career.

Florence Alberta Shilling McClure (September 26, 1921 – November 5, 2009) was an American activist.

==Early life==

McClure was born Florence Alberta Schilling on September 26, 1921, in Centralia, Illinois. She attended MacMurray College for Women and then transferred to Hardin Business College. After graduating in October 1941, she worked for the government during World War II where she met her husband, James McClure, an officer in the United States Air Force, while she was working at the Security and Intelligence Division in Miami, Florida. The couple had two children, James and Carolyn, and after her husband retired from the military during the 1950s, the family moved to California.

==Career and activism==

In 1966, they moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. McClure was hired by Burton Cohen, who she assisted in opening the New Frontier Hotel and Casino. She helped develop it into a popular resort and became one of the first female executives in the resort industry. She then worked as office manager to Howard Hughes at the Desert Inn. She was one of the founders of the Las Vegas chapter of Soroptimist International. She joined the Las Vegas chapter of the League of Women Voters in 1966 and later became the state president. She was inspired by fellow activist Jean Ford who she met through the organization. McClure also joined the Nevada Women's Lobby.

McClure began studying for her bachelor's degree in 1969 when she was 48, graduating from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a degree in sociology in 1971. She worked with Sandi Petta to found Community Action Against Rape (CAAR), a crisis rape center that originally operated out of her family's living room. She petitioned state senator Richard Bryan in 1975 to change the law allowing rape victims to be questioned about their sexual history. She also successfully challenged state laws on marital rape, child pornography and victim compensation.

When a new women's prison was proposed to be built in Pioche, McClure successfully blocked the project, forcing it to be opened instead in North Las Vegas where it would be more easily accessible to families. The prison was renamed in her honor, the Florence McClure Women's Correctional Center, in 2007.

==Death and legacy==

McClure died on November 5, 2009, at the age of 88. A documentary was made about her life titled "Hurricane Flo", produced by Marlene Adrian.

[[Investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales]]

CATEGORIES: 1969 in Wales, July 1969 events in the United Kingdom, Charles III, Ceremonies in the United Kingdom, Caernarfon

The investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III) took place in Caernarfon Castle, north Wales, on 1 July 1969. The ceremony formally presented the title of Prince of Wales to the 20-year-old Charles, eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II. He was the 21st heir to the English or British throne to hold the title. The investiture was a revival of a ceremony which had first been used for the previous prince of Wales, Edward (Charles's great-uncle), in 1911. The 1969 event was watched by 500 million people worldwide on television, but it received opposition in particular from Welsh nationalist organisations.

==Background==

The title Prince of Wales is one that has traditionally been bestowed to the male heir apparent of the English or British monarch, since Edward I of England gave his son Edward of Caernarfon the title in 1284. The bestowal is not automatic, however, nor hereditary. Edward had been born in Caernarfon Castle in 1284, possibly a deliberate statement by Edward I to the recently conquered Welsh. The Prince of Wales title came with the royal lands in Wales, as well as the title Earl of Chester. The Prince of Wales spent five weeks in Caernarfon in 1301 but would never return again.

After rising against the English, native Welshman Owain Glyndwr proclaimed himself Prince of Wales in 1400 but, since his defeat in 1409, the title has reverted to a ceremonial one, given to heirs of the English throne.

Queen Elizabeth II made her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester by letters patent on 26 July 1958 when he was only nine years old. He was the 21st to be given the title. Elizabeth's uncle Edward, the future King Edward VIII, had been the previous Prince of Wales and had been invested in the title at Caernarfon Castle in 1911 before becoming King in 1936. The 1911 ceremony was a new invention, though using medieval symbolism, which would be repeated by Charles's investiture in 1969.

The investiture was preceded by a year-long promotional campaign called "Croeso '69" (Welcome '69) designed to raise the profile of Wales and promote tourism. The UK's Labour government had ambitions to modernise Britain, including Wales where old industries were being replaced by new businesses and technology.

The 1911 gold coronet, having gone missing, needed to be replaced in 1969, though by one with a modern design.  After the death of the Duke of Windsor – the former Edward VIII – in 1972, the old coronet was found in his possessions.

Ten days prior to the investiture, a documentary co-produced by the BBC and ITV called Royal Family was broadcast, showing the royals going about their everyday lives. It raised the royal family to the forefront of the public eye.

==Event==

Charles was formally invested with the title Prince of Wales at a ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 1 July 1969. The event was organised by a specially established Investiture Committee, chaired by the earl marshal, Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk. With a growing national consciousness rising in Wales at the time, the investiture needed to celebrate both the pride in Wales and the current British monarchy.

Charles's uncle Lord Snowdon, being a professional photographer, arranged the ceremony to be television-friendly. The ceremony took place on a circular slate dais shielded by a large modern canopy of perspex which allowed the audience and television cameras to watch the proceedings.

Prior to the investiture, Charles spent nine weeks at Aberystwyth University learning to speak the Welsh language, taught by Welsh nationalist Dr Tedi Millward. Charles consequently was able to give a speech at the investiture, in Welsh and English, where he pledged "to associate himself in word and deed with as much of the life of the Principality as possible".

For an hour prior to the arrival of the royal family, a procession of dignitaries and guests paraded through the town and entered the castle through the Water Gate, led by the king's heralds with a guard of honour of the Welsh Guards. Several dozen teenagers followed, representatives of Welsh youth. Then came the invited members of the House of Lords, the members and aldermen of Caernarvon Borough Council, members of the Gorsedd and the National Eisteddfod Court, chairmen of the 13 Welsh county councils, county sheriffs and the Welsh MPs. Church representatives arrived, then the prime minister, Harold Wilson, and his wife, Mary; the home secretary, James Callaghan; and the chiefs of staff of the armed forces.

Members of the royal family arrived in a fleet of four cars, led by the lord lieutenant of Caernarvonshire. Finally Charles arrived in an open carriage accompanied by his equerry, David Checketts, and the secretary of state for Wales, George Thomas, to a rendition of God Bless the Prince of Wales by the Band of the Welsh Guards.

In front of the invited audience of 4,000 people inside the castle, Charles came to the stage and knelt on a scarlet cushion. The secretary of state for Wales read the Letters Patent in Welsh as the Queen gave Charles a golden rod, a mantle, a sword, a girdle, the new coronet and a ring. The prince then took an oath, announcing:

The prince kissed his mother on the cheek before being led by the Queen to the balcony of the Queen's Gate to greet the crowds waiting outside the castle. He later sat himself on a throne, between two further thrones occupied by the Queen to one side and his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, sitting to the other side.

The ceremony was broadcast live on BBC television, in black and white on BBC1 and in colour on BBC2, from 10:30nbspam until 4:30nbsppm. It was also broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and bilingually on BBC Radio 4 Wales. It had an audience of 19 million in the UK and 500 million worldwide. Though 250,000 visitors were predicted for Caernarfon, only about 90,000 visited the town to see the event for themselves. It was believed many people chose to watch the ceremony at home on television instead.

Following the event, Charles spent four days touring Wales by car, helicopter and the royal yacht. Leaving the royal yacht in Llandudno the day after the investiture (and rejoining the yacht at various points on the trip), the Prince visited Newtown, New Quay, St Davids, Gelli Aur, Llanelli, Swansea, Merthyr Tydfil (Cyfarthfa Castle), Newport and Cardiff. He ended the tour with a presentation at the City Hall and a concert at the New Theatre.

==Opposition==

The 1960s movement surrounding the investiture has historically been described as the "anti-investiture movement"207 and "anti-investiture sentiment". The investiture occurred during a period of revival of the Welsh national consciousness with an outspoken section considering it as an English Prince being imposed upon Wales.

The investiture faced fierce opposition from people who saw the Prince of Wales as symbolic of Wales's occupation by the English crown. Nationalist anti-English sentiment had been on the rise, particularly since 1957 when a Welsh valley was flooded to provide water for the English city of Liverpool. Charles later recalled "most days there seemed to be a demonstration going on against me" when he was studying at Aberystwyth University.

In November 1967, as the Earl of Snowdon visited Cardiff to discuss arrangements for the investiture, a bomb went off.

Communities and institutions were divided on the issue of the investiture. These included the Urdd, Plaid Cymru, the Gorsedd and non-conformist denominations. Students in all of the University of Wales campuses held multiple sit-in protests and hunger strikes to show their opposition to the investiture. The FWA and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru also added to the tension. Because of the tension and protests leading up to the investiture of July 1969, the UK government drafted many soldiers and detectives, as well as agents provocateurs, to ensure a smoothly running ceremony in Caernarfon. Campaigning was led by Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (MAC, Movement for the Defence of Wales) and the Free Wales Army, with the situation described before the investiture as "something close to open warfare between the Government's police and young people of Wales".

Welsh singer Dafydd Iwan voiced his opposition and protest against investing Charles as Prince of Wales and also wrote a song "Carlo" mocking Charles. Iwan stated "is a song to be taken lightly, ... like the Investiture itself, and every other vanity. The shame is that there was meaning and a serious purpose to role of Prince of Wales once". The 25-year-old  Dafydd Iwan's song became a popular anthem at the time.

The Welsh language youth festival, the Urdd Eisteddfod, elected not to send representatives to the investiture. But, due to their 1969 festival taking place in Aberystwyth where Charles was studying, the prince was invited to speak at the event. Protests erupted at the moment Charles started his speech, with two large groups simultaneously walking out shouting slogans including "Urdd has been betrayed". 

Tedi Millward, professor of Welsh at Aberystwyth University, became friendly with Charles in the lead-up to the investiture whilst teaching him some Welsh. He refused invitations to the investiture ceremony, as well as the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. Charles himself said in 2019 "Every day I had to go down to the town where I went to these lectures, and most days there seemed to be a demonstration going on against me".

The investiture of Charles as "Prince of Wales was controversial and also led to widespread protests in Wales. The group "Cofia 1282" ("Remember 1282", the death year of Llywelyn the Last) also held protests against the investiture.

The Welsh Language society (Cymdeithas yr Iaith) also held a rally against the investiture on 29 August, 1969 at Cilmeri, the site of the death of Llywelyn the Last.206

The day before the 1969 investiture, two members of MAC were killed when their home-made bomb exploded prematurely in Abergele, while they were planting it on a local government building. There were false speculations that they had intended to blow up the royal train.

===Day of investiture===

On the day of the investiture, a few nonviolent protesters were arrested. Some were escorted away carrying signs saying "Cymru nid Prydain" (Wales not Britain). Others booed and made obscene gestures at the royal carriages.235 One protestor threw an egg at the Queen’s carriage as it passed by. Another threw a banana skin under the feet of the military escort as it processed by.

On the day of the ceremony, a young man threw an egg at the Queen's carriage, and he was leapt upon by the surrounding crowd. Helicopters flew overhead, drain covers in Caernarfon were sealed, and radio stations were surrounded by barbed wire, which meant a planned stormingOctober 2022 of Caernarfon Castle was impossible.

==In popular culture==

The Prince of Wales's investiture was recreated during season 3 of the Netflix television series, The Crown. Episode 6, named Tywysog Cymru (Prince of Wales) was first broadcast in November 2019, and portrays Charles's attendance at Aberystwyth University where he learnt to speak Welsh. The episode diverts from reality by showing Charles rewriting a Welsh-only speech to express an affinity with the Welsh struggle against oppression.

[[Triumph Over the Grave]]

CATEGORIES: 2018 short stories, American short stories, Works by Denis Johnson

"Triumph Over the Grave" is a short story by Denis Johnson first appearing in his collection The Largesse of the Sea Maiden published in 2018 by Random House. 

==Plot==

"Triumph Over the Grave" is a  discursive journey composed of vignette-like episodes, perhaps autobiographical or fictional. The unnamed narrator, a writer in his sixties living in San Francisco, recounts the lives - and deaths - of now-deceased friends, literary associates, and mentors. 

The story opens with an incident at a restaurant involving a case of mistaken identity: the narrator confuses a red-headed woman for Nan, the spouse of his friend Robert, both of whom live in New York City. A phone call leads to the narrator's discovery that Robert had died suddenly that morning. The news leaves the narrator profoundly shaken. 

The narrator, who in his youth led a precarious existence, describes his early efforts to become a successful author. He announces to the reader, "I'll write a story for you right now" which he titles "The Examination of My Right Knee", a tale concerning a failed operation for his trick knee, during which he was hallucinating on LSD.

The critical vignettes of the story relate the narrator's role as a witness to the death struggles of two elderly literary associates: Darcy Miller and "Link" Linkwits. Miller descends into madness— or perhaps enlightenment—as he succumbs to lung cancer. Linkwits, who the narrator had served as a caregiver and personal secretary, is defiant and stoic to the end before dying from cancer. Neither man goes gently into the night.

The story closes with the narrator's report that Nan, Robert's widow, had suddenly passed away after a short illness. The narrator writes: "It doesn't matter. The world keeps turning. It's plain to you that at the time I write this, I'm not dead. But maybe by the time you read it."

==Theme==

"Triumph Over the Grave" is a final testament to Johnson's career as a writer, a memoir of his struggles all of which are "linked by the death of friends." Critic David L. Ulin emphasizes the revealing, memoir-like elements of the story:

Author Troy Jollimore comments on the relationship between theme and style in the story:

Jollimore adds that " "Triumph Over the Grave", in essence,...gestures toward the deepest mysteries of our existence on this planet."

Critic Gavin Corbett observes that in "Triumph Over the Grave', the narrator traces over a stream of past events, but here he is literally writing his memories out—what we're reading is his testament to these personally significant episodes, all linked by the deaths of friends."

Johnson provides a striking image of death, symbolized by circling turkey vultures, noted by Corbett:

Social commentator Sandy English remarks upon the same passage: "On one visit Miller's ranch , there are buzzards in the sky…We hear the 'demoralized lowing of distant cattle' and the narrator says, 'I saw nothing, really … to suggest that anybody cared what went on here or even knew of the existence of this place.' This seems to catch the feeling of many places in America today."

Johnson was dying of liver cancer when he completed his 2018 collection of short fiction, and he closes "Triumph Over the Grave" with this: "The world keeps turning. It plain to you at the time I write this, I'm not dead. But maybe by the time you read it."

Critic Kevin Zambrano observes that "In the story's final lines, the narrator's all-but-explicit evocation of his author takes a startling, haunting turn."

Author David L. Ulin, commenting on the collection that includes "Triumph Over the Grave" writes:

[[Alexander Stewart (diplomat)]]

CATEGORIES: 1593 deaths, Court of James VI and I

Alexander Stewart (died 1593) was a Scottish courtier and diplomat.

He was a younger son of Alexander Stewart of Scotstounhill, a captain of Blackness Castle, and Elizabeth Hamilton.

==Blackness Castle==

The older Alexander Stewart's record as captain of Blackness for the Scottish crown was a subject of comment by Richard Bannatyne. In March 1572, during the Marian Civil War, he surrendered the castle to the supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, for 300 crowns, after his expenses had not been met by the King's side. In January 1573, he was made captain again, and pledged his eldest son as hostage for his good service. 

Unfortunately, while he was making these arrangements in Edinburgh, one of his prisoners, James Kirkcaldy bribed the guards and took Blackness. Kirkcaldy then managed to capture Alexander Stewart and his brother John and locked them up in their own castle. Alexander Stewart set about bribing the same soldiers and Regent Morton forced James Kirkcaldy's wife Helen Leslie to make him surrender. When Helen Leslie came to Blackness, James Kirkcaldy came to the iron yett to welcome her and his soldiers shut him out and pelted him with stones from the tower. 

Other sources suggest that James Kirkcaldy, brother of the Marian leader William Kirkcaldy of Grange, surrendered Blackness to Regent Morton after a conventional siege.

==Mission to England==

Robert Bowes was told in December 1582 that Alexander Stewart, son of the captain of Blackness, knew of plans to destabilize the Ruthven regime, an English-leaning Scottish government. It was said that Alexander Stewart and others including the sons of Lord Seton would surprise the king at Holyrood Palace.

In 1586 Alexander Stewart, the son, was involved in negotiations after Mary, Queen of Scots, had been sentenced to death in England. James VI sent him with messages to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. In London, Stewart joined other Scottish diplomats including the Master of Gray and Robert Melville. In January 1587, his actions displeased his colleagues, who felt he was undermining their work to save the queen's life. Melville wrote that Stewart had exceeded his credit as a diplomat and was insisting that he alone knew the king's mind. It remains unclear if Stewart was acting with special instructions from James VI. He was sent to Scotland without the consent of the other diplomats and brought letters from the Earl of Leicester to James VI which discredited the Master of Gray.

George Young, another negotiator in London, was disappointed by Stewart's conduct as a diplomat, and wrote to William Cecil that he was, "sory in gude faith that he or any Scottisman sould overshute himself sa farre in a mater quhilk I doubt not his majestie will let appeare mair clearlie".

==Bridge Castle==

In March 1587, his parents and older brother James Stewart sold the lands and castle of Little Ogilface in Brighouse near Torphichen to William Livingstone, 6th Lord Livingston. The castle, probably built by James Stewart and his wife Helen Sinclair, is now known as "Bridge Castle".

==Feud==

Alexander Stewart became involved in a feud between a wealthy lawyer, John Graham of Hallyards, and the Sandilands family which followed a dubious property transaction. On 13 February 1593 James Sandilands of Slamannan, the Duke of Lennox, and Alexander Stewart were going to play golf. They encountered John Graham and his followers on Leith Wynd. The Grahams opened fire and Stewart and was killed by head wound. John Graham was shot and carried to a nearby house where Stewart's French page stabbed him to death.

[[Child-headed family]]

CATEGORIES: Family

A child-headed family or child-headed household is a family in which a minor has become the head of the household. They are most common in developing countries and areas of conflict, where the children's parents have been killed by conflict or disease.  In some cases, relatives of the children adopt them after the parents die. Situations where a child, usually the eldest, has to provide for the family happen when there are no adult relatives to take the children or the relatives can not afford to support more children. Whether and how much the government helps the orphaned family depends on the country. Most help comes from charity and aid organisations like UNICEF.

Child-headed families are most common in Africa. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has led to many situations where both parents have died and left behind a family of orphans. The children may begin taking over their parent's responsibilities before the last surviving parent has died, when the parent is sick or too weak to work. The eldest children often have to stop going to school and get a job instead in order to gain income for the family. A study by Cornell University in 2005 showed that, in Namibia, the average age of the children acting as parents in their families was 17; some were as young as 9 years old. The number of children heading households in sub-Saharan Africa is reported to be growing. A survey in South Africa in 2006 showed that 122,000 (0.67%) of the country's children were living in child-headed households.

In Rwanda, it is estimated that the 1994 genocide left at least 60,000 households to be run by children. Many of the girls who were raped during the conflict were left with raising both their siblings and their own children.

[[Death of Anush Apetyan]]

Anush Apetyan (Armenian: Անուշ Ապետյան), (1986 – 13 or 14 September 2022) was an Armenian female soldier who was tortured, mutilated, raped and killed by Azerbaijani forces during the September 2022 Armenia–Azerbaijan clashes in the city of Jermuk. Apetyan had three children, aged 16, 15 and 4.

==Killing==

During the invasion by Azerbaijan of the Armenian lands between September 13 and 14, an Armenian soldier named Anush Apetyan was captured alive by Azerbaijani forces alongside more than 10 Armenian soldiers captured alive, upon the Armenian Ministry of Defense.

After that, the video of torture and mutilation of a woman captured by Azerbaijani soldiers was first released on Telegram and after a while it was found that the woman is the Armenian soldier Anush Apetyan. In that video it was obvious that she had been tortured and mutilated, her legs were cut off, at least one finger was cut off and placed in her mouth, and one eye was poked out and replaced with a stone, and it was while the Azerbaijani soldiers surrounding her were celebrating and mocking her.

==Reactions==

On 20 September 2022 Dicle Amed Women's Platform (DAKP) spokesperson Kıymet Yıldır recalled and condemned the killing of Anush Apetyan by Azerbaijani forces, during the gathering of women in some cities of Turkey like Van, Diyarbakır and Istanbul which held to condemning both the killing of Jina Amini by the Iranian police and also Anush Apetyan.

Armenian Women's Union issued a statement read by co-chairs Anahîd Qasabyan and Arbî Kespiryan, at the Leader Öcalan Park in Hasakah, AANES, condemned the killing of Armenian female soldier Anush Apetyan by Azerbaijani forces and of Jina Amini by the Iranian regime, and call on all women to unite against tyranny.

Senator Bob Menendez, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, called for an end to financial and military aid to Azerbaijan after the discovery of this video, considering that the foreign policy of the United States cannot assist terrorist states that commit war crimes.

For the Lemkin Institute for the Prevention of Genocide, this war crime is part of a “genocidal policy” on the part of Azerbaijan towards the Armenian population.

[[2024 Sindh provincial election]]

CATEGORIES: Elections in Sindh, 2023 elections in Pakistan, Future elections in Pakistan

Provincial elections are scheduled to be held in Sindh within 90 days after the early dissolution of the Sindh Assembly on 11 August 2023. This means that the election must be held by or before 9 November 2023. However, on 5 August 2023, after the approval of the results of the 2023 digital census by the Council of Common Interests headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, elections will be delayed for several months, as new delimitations will be published on 14 December 2023. The likely impact of this is polls not being held until February 2024 at the earliest.

==Electoral system==

The 168 seats of the Sindh Assembly consist of 130 general seats, whose members are elected by the first-past-the-post voting system through single-member constituencies. 29 seats are reserved for women and 9 seats are reserved for non-Muslims. The members on these seats are elected through proportional representation based on the total number of general seats secured by each political party.

==Background==

In the 2018 election, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won 99 seats, gaining a majority in the Provincial Assembly. It became the third consecutive time that the PPP was able to form government in Sindh Since 2008.

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) became the largest party in Karachi by winning 21 out of 44 seats from the city. It was the first time since 1988 that any party other than the MQM-P got the mandate to represent the city on the provincial and national levels. Overall, the PTI won 30 seats and became the second largest party, and the largest party in the opposition.

The Muttahida Qaumi Movement - Pakistan (MQM-P), which was the largest and most popular party in Karachi, Hyderabad and other urban areas of Sindh, faced a tough challenge from the rising popularity of the PTI and received its worst ever result. It won only 21 seats and became the third largest party in the province. The MQM-P also opted to join the opposition.

In April 2022, after circumstances arising during a political crisis in Pakistan after the successful no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, the MQM-P left the opposition and joined the PPP-led provincial government.

In September 2022, Former Prime Minister and Leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Imran Khan announced to liberate Sindh from Zardari Mafia. He stated that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf will team up with the youth to liberate the poor and oppressed people of Interior Sindh from Feudal lords of Pakistan People's Party. This was the very first time some party leader threatened dominance of People's Party in Sindh and upcoming election will be a battle for survival of PPP in interior Sindh as Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has support of the people of Karachi and Hyderabad and will be able to gain seats in Interior Sindh if they campaign well.

===Merger of MQM factions===

Since the appointment of Kamran Tessori as the Governor of Sindh, efforts began to merge breakaway factions of the MQM-P like the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) and the Farooq Sattar group back into the MQM-P to unite their vote bank to overcome the growing popularity of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The Mohajir Qaumi Movement Pakistan - Haqiqi (MQM-H) was also approached, but refused to merge the with the MQM-P.

On the evening of 12 January 2023 Mustafa Kamal, the leader of the PSP, and Farooq Sattar announced their merger with the MQM-P in a press conference.

[[I Never Felt Nun]]

CATEGORIES: 2022 debut albums, EST Gee albums, Interscope Records albums, Collective Music Group albums

I Never Felt Nun is the debut studio album by American rapper EST Gee. It was released through Interscope Records, Collective Music Group, and Warlike on September 16, 2022. The album features guest appearances from Future, Jack Harlow, Bryson Tiller, Machine Gun Kelly, and Jeezy.

==Background==

The day the album was released, EST Gee spoke about it in an interview with Apple Music DJ Zane Lowe:I don't want to put my beliefs, my feelings off on other people, but just, you got to stay motivated. 'Cause a lot of time it don't seem like it get better. You know what I'm saying? But you got to make it better. So that feeling of not feeling nothing... You know what I'm saying? That shit's basically just keep going through it, don't let it affect you. Before I knew to tell myself, that's how I really was. You know what I'm saying? So that's just what that album's about.

==Release and promotion==

On September 6, 2022, EST Gee announced the album along with its title and release date. The next day, he revealed the tracklist, which had all the featured artists unannounced. The day after that, the features were announced in a new format of the tracklist that he posted in collaboration with Spotify hip hop playlist RapCaviar.

===Singles===

The lead single of the album, "Blood", was released on July 29, 2022. It was followed up with the second single, "Love Is Blind", which was released on August 12, 2022. The third single, "Hell", was released on September 1, 2022. The fourth single, "Shoot It Myself", which features fellow American rapper Future, was released on September 9, 2022. The fifth and final single, "Backstage Passes", which features fellow American rapper Jack Harlow, was sent to US rhythmic contemporary radio on October 11, 2022.

==Critical reception==

I Never Felt Nun received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic wrote, "Louisville rapper EST Gee brings his imposing presence, trauma-fixated lyricism, and deft ability to navigate a hard beat to his debut studio album." Nadine Smith of Pitchfork wrote, "Though rap has reached vast new emotional depths in the last decade, Gee's confessionals are still startling in how bluntly they address the demons head-on. EST Gee's lyricism doesn't bring the catharsis of a therapy session or the removed vantage point of hindsight; I Never Felt Nun comes straight from the heart, hardened like armor." Paul Attard of Slant was slightly more mixed, writing, "The title of Gee's first studio album indicates his continuing disassociation from his emotions."

[[Synagogue (John Singer Sargent)]]

CATEGORIES: Paintings by John Singer Sargent, Public art in Boston

Synagogue is an allegorical mural by John Singer Sargent in the Boston Public Library. It is part of Sargent's larger Triumph of Religion mural cycle in the library's central branch at Copley Square. Synagogue was unveiled in 1919, and it sparked immediate controversy. The cowering and feeble personification of the Synagogue stood in contrast with Sargent's glorified depiction of the Church in the mural cycle, and members of the Jewish community observed that the series delivered an implicit message of Jewish decline and Christian triumph. Sargent was reluctant to respond publicly to criticism of the work, but privately wrote in 1919, "I am in hot water with the Jews, who resent my ‘Synagogue,’ and want to have it removed– and tomorrow a ‘prominent’ member of the Jewish colony is coming to bully me about it and ask me to explain myself. I can only refer him to Rheims, Notre Dame, Strasbourg and other Cathedrals, and dwell at length about the good old times."233 Responding to charges that the work was anti-Semitic, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill ordering the removal of the mural in 1922, but the law was soon repealed, and the work has remained in place.236

==Background: Triumph of Religion==

The Triumph of Religion is a commissioned work by Sargent at the Boston Public Library. In official correspondence with the library, Sargent described it as "Triumph of Religion—a mural decoration illustrating certain stages of Jewish and Christian religious history." Designed and painted in London, the cycle is divided into 17 works that were transferred to Boston in installments. Sargent began sketching the murals in 1891, and the cycle remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1925.

Synagogue and its counterpart, Church, appear on the East wall, on either side of a space reserved for a depiction of Jesus giving the Sermon on the Mount, which was never finished.

==Iconography==

Scholars have identified many themes and influences in the larger mural cycle. Sally M. Promey identifies three key themes: individualism and subjectivity overcoming law and doctrine; a reaction to World War I; and concealment and revelation. She also notes the visual similarity between Synagogue and the Cumaean Sibyl in Michaelangelo’s Sistine Chapel. Sargent also may have been influenced by the writing of Ernest Renan.

==Antisemitism controversy==

Even before Synagogue was unveiled to the public, there were already fears about Sargent's handling of the religious subject matter. Promey writes that prior to the mural’s installment, Boston Herald critic  Frederick William Coburn opined that "in the interest of racial and religious amenity in this community, one hopes that Mr. Sargent has avoided the old middle-age bigotry in working out this perilous theme, as no doubt he has done." Given the antisemitism and immigration restriction of the 1920's, Sargent’s treatment of religion had the potential to be extremely divisive. Indeed, after the painting was revealed, many viewers did find it offensive, and there were numerous attempts to remove it in subsequent years.

===Ideological criticisms===

Critics of the painting objected to the representation of the Synagogue as a huddled woman wearing a blindfold, especially next to the representation of the Christian church, a pietà . It seemed to many to represent a triumph of Christianity, rather than one of religion. Leo Franklin, the President of Reform Judaism’s Central Conference found that the painting presented "Judaism as a broken faith, as a faith without a future," and therefore should not be placed in a public library. This depiction of Judaism, in addition to being offensive, was also historically inaccurate. Massachusetts State Representative Coleman Silbert wrote that the representation “represented Judaism as downfallen or dead, which is far from the truth... it is against the broad spirit of Americanism." Artist Rose Kohler also found the work to be un-American, writing that "it was felt that in this century and in America, we had advanced sufficiently to cast aside the notions and prejudices of the dark ages." She also designed a monument in response to Sargent’s painting, a medallion entitled Spirit of the Synagogue, which depicted the Synagogue figure as upright and triumphant.

Due to the antisemitic nature of the painting, many asserted that it was inappropriately placed in a public, educational building. The rabbi Henry Raphael Gold found its placement to be unfair to Jewish students. Coburn called the placement of such a mural "distasteful… in a building supported by public taxation."

===Proposed removal===

The first attempt to remove the painting occurred just after it was unveiled in 1919, when local citizens circulated an unsuccessful petition.

Shortly after, many organizations wrote to the library, arguing for the removal of the painting. These included the National Council of Jewish Women, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Young Women’s Hebrew Association, the Young Men’s Hebrew Association, and the Anti Defamation League, as well as the Federation of Churches and Young Men’s Christian Association. However, the library asserted that because the painting was the result of a contract between Sargent and citizen donors, the library could not legally take it down. The library also cited the recent court case Eliot v Trinity Church, which concerned a different public religious artwork: a statue of Philips Brooks at Trinity Church, directly across the street in Copley Square.April 2023

In 1922, Representative Silbert introduced a bill that would allow the state to remove the painting, which passed in the Senate and was signed by the Governor. The bill would have seized the painting by right of eminent domain. However, the bill was struck down as unconstitutional, and repealed in 1924.

On February 2, 1924, The New York Times reported that a "black, inklike substance" was thrown on the painting.

===Defense and Sargent's response===

Sargent himself, averse to controversy and public statements, said little to the press about the controversy. One Boston newspaper reported in 1922 that he "made it known through a friend that no reflection on the Jewish race was intended."189 Privately, he asserted that the painting was justified due to its medieval precedent, and expressed gratitude that the library allowed it to remain.

After the installation of Synagogue, the final panel of the cycle, a representation of the Sermon on the Mount, was never installed. Although it could be argued that Sargent’s death caused the mural to remain unfinished, Promey notes that Sargent never tried to collect his final payment for the mural, pointing towards the fact that he had stopped working on it.

The American Fine Art Society, following the controversy, passed a resolution defending Sargent, and American Art News wrote that, "whether judiciously chosen or not, the subject was historically correct. It belonged logically in the series."

==Present status==

The painting remains visible in the Boston Public Library today. Between 2003 and 2004, the Triumph of Religion cycle was restored by the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at Harvard University.

Georgios Drakos (Γεώργιος Δράκος; 1788–1827) was a Souliot chieftan of the Greek War of Independence.

==Biography==

Drakos was born in Souli in 1788. While the Ottoman Albanian forces were besieging, they attempted to take control of spring from which the Souliotes got water. Certain of victory, they encamped with 6000 soldiers. Georgios Drakos reportedly fought them with a force of only 18 men, and managed to repulse them until Notis Botsaris came with reinforcements, and declared Drakos the hero of the victory.

In the 1821 Battle of Pente Pigadia, Drakos lead a contingent of only 300 men. He also took part in other battles, in Panassari in 1824, in Kolovates in 1825, in the campaign of Karaiskakis in Eastern Greece, as commander-in-chief in the siege of Salona, in Distomo against the Pasha of Karystos and Karofilbei.

He died in Chalkida in 1827. He was a prisoner of Kutahi and was being taken to Euboea to recover, when Kutahi's guards killed him by order and said he committed suicide. His widow Susana and his orphaned children settled in Nafpaktos in 1829, together with the families of Athanasios, Georgios (grandfather and first cousin of the General) and Nikolaos Drakos.

Marie-Claire Schanne-Klein is a French physicist who is a professor at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. She is based in the Laboratory for Optics and Biosciences, where she studies the nonlinear optics of chiral molecules.

==Early life and education==

Schanne-Klein studied physics at the École polytechnique. She moved to the Paris-Sud University for graduate studies focused on lasers, before returning to École polytechnique for doctoral research, where she worked on non-linear optics.

==Research and career==

Schanne-Klein combines theoretical and experimental approaches to better understand molecular materials. Specifically, she studies nonlinear optics of chiral molecules and second-harmonic generation imaging of collagen fibres. Using Hyper–Rayleigh scattering, Schanne-Klein showed that the hyperpolarizability of collagen fibres, which forms the basis of the contrast observed in non-linear optical measurements, occurred due to the coherent amplification of peptide bonds along the lengths of the molecules.

Schanne-Klein has applied her understanding of spectroscopy to understand aged parchments. These parchments often contain collagen, and Schanne-Klein showed that non-linear optical microscopy could be used to evaluate degradation within the material.

Schanne-Klein is a professor at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the École polytechnique.

In 2019 Schanne Klein was awarded the CNRS Silver Medal.

[[Hilario Rivas Reynolds]]

CATEGORIES: 1799 births, 1888 deaths, Bolivian military personnel, People from La Paz

Hilario Remigio Rivas Reynolds (19 April 1799 – 29 November 1888) was a Bolivian military officer and Commander of the Bolivian Army during the presidency of José María Pérez de Urdininea. He was a loyal supporter of Andrés de Santa Cruz and would be one of the only military officers not to desert him before the Battle of Yungay.

==Early life==

Rivas was the son of Antonio Miguel Rivas Portillo and Juana Manuela Reynolds Carter. At a young age, his parents arranged his marriage to the member of a prominent Upper Peruvian family, Eloísa Cifuentes Godoy. The marriage was unhappy and they had no children. Rivas would join the patriot army soon after Eloísa’s family’s hacienda was raided by the royalist army. The controversy regarding this matter being that her family was only suspected of having patriot sympathies. In fact, her family was loyal to the Spanish and had been raided only to obtain plunder. In protest, Rivas joined the patriot cause but soon was arrested. However, his imprisonment was rudimentary, as he was locked in a room at the Recoleta convent in Sucre. He easily fled soon afterwards and headed to New Granada.

In Bolivar's Army 

He was able to enlist in Bolívar’s army and participated in the battles of Pichincha, Junín, and Ayacucho. Because of his courage, he was promoted to the rank of colonel by Bolívar himself after Ayacucho. He was dispatched alongside general Pedro Blanco to crush the remnants of the royalist army in his home of Upper Peru. The final royalist army under Pedro Antonio Olañeta was soon defeated in the battle of Tumusla, in which Rivas would again distinguish himself due to his virtues and valour. 

==The Bolivian Republic==

The early years (1825-1829) 

With the war of independence over, Rivas was offered Peruvian citizenship and offered the rank of brigadier general. However, he rejected and opted to remain in Upper Peru where he supported the creation of the Republic of Bolívar, later Bolivia. 

Now in the service of the nascent Bolivian nation, Rivas was a staunch supporter of Bolívar and Sucre. He was with Sucre when the liberator was wounded during a mutiny by the Neogranadine army, which was stationed in Bolivia in 1828. Sucre’s successor, José María Pérez de Urdininea, to whom Rivas was aide-de-camp, would promote him to brigadier general. Urdininea was only a temporary replacement for Sucre and was soon replaced by José Miguel de Velasco, who failed to convince the national congress to elect him president. Therefore, Andrés de Santa Cruz was chosen in his stead. 

Santa Cruz's presidency (1829-1839) 

Rivas would serve Santa Cruz loyally. However, Santa Cruz did not trust him and reduced his position and powers by isolating him and rarely involving him in plans of state. Regardless, Rivas fought valiantly and loyally by his side in the battles of Socabaya, Yanacocha, and Yungay. With Santa Cruz ousted in 1839, Rivas, having stayed loyal, found himself an enemy of general Velasco, who was now president. Velasco had betrayed Santa Cruz even before knowing the outcome of Yungay. Rivas loathed Velasco and had actually actively opposed his candidacy for the presidency in 1829. 

Later in 1839, Rivas decided to leave Bolivia for Spain. He had abandoned his wife at this point and the two would not meet again. Eloísa would die in 1848. 

Return to Bolivia

With his wife now deceased, Rivas inherited a sizable fortune which placed him in a better position. At the time of his return, Bolivia was under the rule of Manuel Isidoro Belzu, the charismatic and populist leader of the people. Rivas offered his services to the caudillo who accepted and charged him with the position of military governor of Oruro. It was there he met his second wife, Antígona Cisneros Guerra. They were married in 1849 and would have one son. In 1857, with the overthrow of Jorge Córdova by José María Linares, Rivas was exiled to Peru.

Because Rivas was opposed to the Linares, Achá, and Melgarejo regimes, he did not return to Bolivia until 1871, when Agustín Morales deposed Mariano Melgarejo. He was received with hostility by the new president, since Morales was a staunch enemy of Belzu and had even made an attempt at the populist caudillo’s life back in 1850. Especially the fact that Rivas’ son, Narciso Rivas Cisneros, was married to Margarita Córdova Belzu, the daughter of Jorge Córdova and granddaughter of Belzu, inclined Morales even more to exile them. 

But Morales was shot dead in 1872 by his nephew and aide-de-camp, supposedly out of self defence. The new president, Tomás Frías would give Rivas the position of governor of La Paz. This would last until Hilarión Daza’s coup in 1877 that deposed Frías’ civilian regime. 

Under Daza, Bolivia would go to war with Chile in the infamous War of the Pacific. His son would enlist as an officer in the Bolivian Army and was killed in the Battle of Tacna, on May 26, 1880. 

Rivas spent the rest of his life in his native city of La Paz and died of natural causes in 1888. The year before his death, he arranged the marriage of his only grandchild with Julio Nardín Estigarribia, a clockmaker of Swiss descent.

==Family==

Rivas was married twice. First with Eloísa Cifuentes Godoy, with whom he had no children. The two would become estranged and eventually she would die in 1848. The marriage is said to have been an unhappy one. Second, Rivas married Antígona Cisneros Guerra in 1849, they had a son: Narciso Rivas Cisneros (15 April 1850 - 26 May 1880); married with Margarita Córdova Belzu and had a daughter, María Rivas Córdova (1871-1911). Through his only granddaughter, María, he is the great-grandfather of the Mayor of La Paz and Minister of National Economy, Luis Nardín Rivas.

Gustavo Aubanel Vallejo (July 23, 1901 – December 9, 1987) was a Mexican physician and politician who served as the first municipal president of Tijuana and third governor of Baja California from 1964 to 1965, after the death of Eligio Esquivel Méndez.

==Biography==

Gustavo Aubanel was born on July 23, 1901, in Guadalajara, Jalisco. His parents were José Aubanel and Mercedes Vallejo. After completing his studies in that city, he graduated in 1927 as a surgeon and midwife at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Guadalajara. He practiced for a time in that region and then moved to Acaponeta, Nayarit and Mexico City.

At the behest of General Agustín Olachea, then governor and military commander of the Northern Territory of Baja California, he moved to Tijuana in 1931. The invitation was to work in the field of medicine, due to the notable lack of public medical services in the border city and for that reason he was appointed director of the Civil and Military Hospital of Tijuana, a position he held for several years. In 1932 and 1943 he was a founding member of the Tijuana Medical Association and in 1950 of the College of Medical Surgeons of Tijuana.

Former Senator Guilebaldo Silva Cota recalled those difficult times when they were concerned about the lack of political rights, because they could not have their laws and choose their rulers. At that time he said that he presented his thesis as a law student which focused on the need to make Baja California a state, which served as support to Dr. Aubanel Vallejo to push the project and finally become a reality.

==Political career==

[[Cork Premier Junior Football Championship]]

CATEGORIES: Cork Premier Junior Football Championship, Gaelic football competitions in County Cork, Junior Gaelic football county championships

The Cork Premier Junior Football Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the Bon Secours Cork Premier Junior Football Championship and abbreviated to the Cork PJFC) is scheduled to be an annual Gaelic football competition organised by the Cork County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association and contested by the top-ranking junior clubs in the county of Cork in Ireland. It is the fifth tier overall in the entire Cork football championship system.

The Cork Premier Junior Championship will be introduced in 2023 following a restructuring of the various intermediate and junior championships.

In its soon-to-be-introduced format, the Cork Premier Junior Championship will begin in late summer. The 12 participating club teams will be divided into three groups of four teams and play each other in a round-robin system. The three group winners and the three runners-up will proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match. The winner of the Cork Premier Junior Championship will qualify for the subsequent Munster Club Championship.

==History==

A restructuring process of the entire Cork football championship system had been underway since voted on by Cork County Board delegates in March 2019. In February 2022, the County Board took a further vote on the future of the club junior and intermediate championships. Delegates voted in favour of creating the Premier Junior Championship, comprising teams formed by the bottom four teams in Intermediate A football in 2022 along with the eight Divisional JAFC winners from 2022.

==Format==

===Group stage===

The 12 teams are divided into three groups of four. Over the course of the group stage, each team plays once against the others in the group, resulting in each team being guaranteed at least three games. Two points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a loss. The teams are ranked in the group stage table by points gained, then scoring difference and then their head-to-head record. The top two teams in each group qualify for the knockout stage.

===Knockout stage===

Quarter-finals: Two lone quarter-finals featuring the four lowest-placed qualifying teams from the group stage. Two teams qualify for the next round.

Semi-finals: The two quarter-final winners and the top two highest-placed qualifying teams from the group stage contest this round. The two winners from these games advance to the final.

Final: The two semi-final winners contest the final. The winning team are declared champions.

===Promotion and relegation===

At the end of the championship, the winning team is automatically promoted to the Cork Intermediate A Championship for the following season. The two worst-ranked teams from the group stage take part in a playoff, with the losing team being relegated to their divisional junior championship.

[[Killing of Cayler Ellingson]]

On September 18, 2022, 18-year-old Cayler Ellingson was killed in a vehicle-ramming attack around McHenry, North Dakota. After he was struck by a Ford Explorer SUV driven by a 41-year-old man, Shannon Brandt, Ellingson was taken to a hospital in Carrington, North Dakota, where he was pronounced dead.

Brandt called 9-1-1.  An initial highway patrol report claimed that Brandt said he attacked Ellingson for being part of a "Republican extremist group". Brandt said that the victim was calling someone else on the phone before he attacked, who was later identified as Ellingson's mother. Brandt reportedly interpreted the call as an attempt to report him to others. According to North Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Bryan Niewind there was "no evidence" to Brandt's assertions "that this incident involved politics". The 911 transcript includes Brandt saying that Ellingson “was saying something about some Republican extremist group,” and that Brandt feared that Ellingson was calling someone to "take care of him."

A blood test found Brandt's blood alcohol content level was 0.08, above the legal limit for driving.

==Arrest and charges==

Brandt was charged with vehicular homicide and released on bail of 50000. However, on September 22, the charges were upgraded to include murder, a class AA felony, the maximum penalty for which is life imprisonment without parole. Foster County, North Dakota State's Attorney Kara Brinster moved that the previous charges, including criminal vehicular homicide, be dismissed. The new charges filed in district court were based on an investigation by the North Dakota Highway Patrol and the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation which included interviews with people involved and an autopsy of the victim.

==Reaction from Donald Trump==

Former US president Donald Trump criticized the media for allegedly not giving the killing sufficient coverage. In a speech in North Carolina on September 23, Trump stated that "Just recently, a young 18-year-old man from North Dakota … was targeted and killed, run down in cold blood with an SUV by a radical left maniac. This guy ran him down and not one mainstream media network has even mentioned this horrible crime... Think of it the other way. Supposing a mad person ran down somebody on the other side, it would be the biggest story you've ever seen."

Beryl Vaughan (July 1, 1919 - April 26, 2016) was an American actress.

==Early years==

Vaughan was born in Monmouthshire, Wales, the daughter of a father who was a draftsman and a mother who was a designer. She and her family came to the United States when she was 4 years old. Her interest in acting and a profession was ignited when she was 8 years old and received 25 cents for a recitation in a church play in St. Louis. When she was 11, she had a 26-week role on a radio serial, after which she "divided her time between radio and school". After she graduated from high school, she attended Wayne University in Detroit for two years before she began to devote more of her time to acting.

==Career==

On Broadway, Vaughan portrayed Janey in Every Man for Himself (1940). She continued in the part for a 15,000-mile tour of the play. Her other acting on stage included having a role in a traveling troupe that performed Claudia.

Vaughn's performances on radio programs included the roles shown in the following table:

She also was heard on Grand Marquee and Uncle Walter's Dog House. In addition to her acting, Vaughan was assistant director of the  Detroit Children's Theater of the Air for 48 weeks, and she read commercials for the Lone Ranger.

The Chicago Press Photographers Association named Vaughan the "most photogenic radio star" in November 1942. The announcement was during the organization's exhibition of news photographs.

Eric Johanson is an American blues rock singer, guitarist, and songwriter. Johanson has performed with Cyril Neville, Anders Osborne, the Neville Brothers, Terrance Simien, JJ Grey, Eric Lindell, Mike Zito, and at events including the Chicago Blues Festival, Edmonton Blues Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and the Byron Bay Bluesfest (Australia).

==Life and career==

He was born and raised in Alexandria, Louisiana, United States, and was presented with his first guitar when he was five years old.  He heard blues music regularly through performances by his family members; one grandfather was a piano tuner and jazz clarinetist, his grandmother was a pianist, and he had aunts proficient on cello and bass. Johanson also acquired a passion for the hard rock recordings of Metallica, Megadeth, and White Zombie.  He played in a local blues band before traveling regularly to New Orleans in his mid-teens, to avail himself of the opportunity to play with more mature and capable musicians. He later relocated there and graduated from the University of New Orleans.  

Johanson became part of the local music scene in New Orleans but, when Hurricane Katrina struck that area in August 2005, he lost his home and nearly all of his possessions. The trauma of the event led to Johanson emigrating to New Zealand in 2006. He returned to New Orleans in 2010, and became an in-demand session musician for artists including Cyril Neville, Anders Osborne, and the Neville Brothers. He also played in the bands of Terrance Simien and Corey Henry's Treme Funktet. In 2017, Johanson's  reputation came to the attention of Tab Benoit, who signed Johanson to his own Whiskey Bayou Records record label. Johanson's debut album, Burn It Down, which included percussion on the recording by Benoit and was produced and engineered by the latter, was released in October that year. It contained 10 original numbers plus Johanson's version of the Chuck Berry penned, "Oh Louisiana". For most of the next two years, Johanson toured with Benoit as part of the Whiskey Bayou Revue. In January 2019, Nola Blue Records issued a duet album, featuring Johanson and his long lost, then re-united, first cousin, Tiffany Pollack, entitled Blues In My Blood. The same year, Johanson took part in a jam concert with the North Mississippi Allstars's Luther Dickinson, at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.

In early 2020, Johanson signed a recording contract with Nola Blue Records. This led to him to his next album, Below Sea Level, which was recorded at Zebra Ranch Studios in the North Mississippi hill country. In addition to Johanson's guitar and vocals, it saw Cody Dickinson play drums, Terrence Grayson on bass, and Ray Jacildo adding a Hammond organ contribution to one track. The collection had all 12 tracks penned by Johanson. Produced by Luther Dickinson, Below Sea Level was released on September 18, 2020. The album's title and one of the tracks therein, "Buried Above Ground", are homages to New Orleans. Johanson stated, "The title of the song refers to the fact that people are typically 'Buried Above Ground' in New Orleans, due to the high water table and the fact that much of the city is actually below sea level. The song itself is an expression of the journey I've been through with the city, leaving and coming back, and figuring out this is where I need to be".

Like many, Johanson had to re-think his approach during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  He decided to issue a weekly, acoustic, live stream of songs, covering a diverse range of music genres, based on social media interaction and requests between Johanson and his fan base. Johanson utilised several high-tech audio recording gadgetry to give an authentic and crystal clear sound quality, including using Pro Tools, noting that the online competition was strong for such a venture. One of the songs tackled was Johanson's resonator guitar rendition of Nine Inch Nails', "Head Like a Hole". In late 2020, Johanson, having had positive feedback from his streamed service, noted "I'm working right now on a little release of acoustic covers. Yeah, which I hope to have out in the spring. Partially that's from requests I've had from a lot of people that have been watching the livestream every week. I thought, let’s do it, it’s a good thing to do in between albums while I’m thinking about the next one coming together".

The demand led to the issue of Covered Tracks, Vol. 1 and Covered Tracks, Vol. 2, in early 2021. The collection housed Johanson's acoustic interpretations of a diverse mix of material including a rendition of Chicago's hit single, "25 or 6 to 4", the evergreen "The House of the Rising Sun" plus Gregg Allman's "Midnight Rider".  Other songs reformulated were The Cardigans' "Feathers and Down", Taj Mahal's "Lovin' in My Baby's Eyes", with the Willie Dixon penned "My Babe", along with the Neville Brothers' "Yellow Moon", the Beatles' "And I Love Her", plus older source material such as Mississippi Fred McDowell's "Goin' Down to the River" and the jazz standard, "My Melancholy Baby".

In the early part of 2022, Johanson issued the double live album, Live at DBA: New Orleans Bootleg. Four of his albums have all made a top ten slot in the Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart. These are Below Sea Level, Covered Tracks: Vol. 1, Covered Tracks: Vol. 2, and Live at DBA: New Orleans Bootleg. One of his more recent contributions was as a guest guitarist on Monk Boudreaux's 2021 album, Bloodstains & Teardrops. In 2023, Johanson released The Deep and the Dirty on Ruf Records; a collection produced by Jesse Dayton. In August 2023, it entered the Billboard chart at number one.

Johanson has performed with Cyril Neville, Anders Osborne, the Neville Brothers, Terrance Simien, JJ Grey, Eric Lindell, Mike Zito, and at events including the Chicago Blues Festival, Edmonton Blues Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and the Byron Bay Bluesfest (Australia).

Playdurizm is a 2020 film directed by Gem Deger. It had its world premiere in 2020 at the Lausanne Underground Film Festival.

==Synopsis==

The film follows the story of a teenager who is trapped in a parallel reality with his favorite idol.

==Cast==

==Reception==

In his review for Screen Anarchy, Andrew Mack said the film is "it's certainly an unconventional feature film debut, written, directed and starring Deger. Officially it's been called in some places a neon-colored fantasy/romance/drama. Deger blends violence, romance, sex and wry moments of comedy into his compact tale. Small in concept and bold in color and style (...)  I am definitely curious to see what this young filmmaker comes up with next."

On CBR, Cass Clarke said that "Playdurizm unwinds its devasting mystery slowly with gleeful amounts of macabre plot twists and plenty of techno color confidence". On Scared Sheepless, Caitlyn Downs gave it a 4/5 rating saying that it is "fiercely original, even when homaging some of the horror genre’s biggest hitters, Playdurizm stands out as a unique, affecting experience that deserves to be seen."

Ticiano Osório of Brazilian newspaper GaúchaZH listed it as one of his favorite films from Fantaspoa pt 2021.

[[I Have Become the Tide]]

CATEGORIES: 2019 Indian novels, Simon & Schuster books, Indian English-language novels

I Have Become the Tide is a novel by Githa Hariharan published in 2019 by Simon & Schuster India. It is her sixth novel, and the third to focus on contemporary India. The book was first published in English, and a Malayalam translation was published in 2020 by Mathrubhumi Books.

==Background==

Githa Hariharan is an Indian writer and editor who has written short stories, novels, and nonfiction essays, and edited collections of fiction and nonfiction essays. I Have Become the Tide is the sixth novel written by Hariharan, and the third to focus on contemporary India. The title of the novel is from the translated title of the poem "I Have Become the Tide" by JV Pawar, and a translated excerpt appears in the epigraph of the book:

In the acknowledgments section, Hariharan writes the novel was "born out of the conviction that no writer can engage with life in India today without taking a stand, in some modest way, on the terrible inequalities that continue to ravage the lives of so many of our fellow citizens."

In a 2019 interview with Firstpost, Hariharan said her novel "was written with Rohith Vemula, and all the Rohiths of India, in the same room. In fact, the novel was written with all the Kalburgis of India in the room as well." In a 2019 interview with SheThePeople, she described the book as "not just a novel. It's my citizen's statement at this point in our collective lives."

==Overview==

The novel is written with three narratives, described by Rogini Mohite in The Hong Kong Review as each "incorporating histories of Dalit resistance to the caste system which has historically subjugated and segregated them to the social and economic margins, labelling them 'Untouchables', over thousands of years." One narrative focuses on a poetry professor with a theory about the origins of the poet-saint Kannadeva. Another narrative follows three Dalit students as they pursue higher education. There is also a narrative set in the past of South India about the son of a cattle skinner.

==Reception==

In a review for The Hindu Business Line, Sharanya Manivannan writes that the novel "is required reading for the contemporary Indian context, a highly recommended novel sowed with verse, which provides an unflinching reminder of the eventualities of hatred." In a review for the Deccan Herald, Soni Wadhwa writes that Hariharan "destabilises the notion that poetry and devotion are a domain of the powerful" and "lets these tropes make space for a different discourse about the oppressed in saying that the oppressed need not always be associated with passivity."

In The Hong Kong Book Review, Ragini Mohite writes, "atrocities against the Dalit community persist in alarming numbers in twenty-first century India" and "it is essential for these subaltern Dalit narratives to be at the forefront of critical discourse and literary production." According to Saudamini Jain in a review for the Hindustan Times, the book is "a well-meaning novel – even if its three inter-linked narratives are essentially oversimplified knock-offs of the stories of Rohith Vemula, MM Kalburgi and a 12th century Bhakti movement." In a review for The Hindu, Latha Anantharaman writes, "The experiences of the three students in I Have Become the Tide will ring true for anyone who has faced discrimination in an educational institution."

In a review for Scroll.in, Harsh Mander writes that "The book fittingly ends with a contemporary Dalit rising, patterned after the Bhim Army." In a review for The Indian Express, Ram Sarangan writes, "While Hariharan’s book is about a call to action, at a certain level, it is also encouraging. ... While seemingly fragile, the voices of defiance and anger do not exist in isolation — they become part of a rising tide."

Yatika Starr Fields' 100' x 20' mural in the Pickens Learning Commons includes several different scenes from Northern Oklahoma College including a woman looking through a microscope, show lambs, another woman looking through a stack of books, men in space looking through VR systems, NOC’s mascot, Mav the bull, the Roustabouts, and the different performing arts. "These all flow in a beautiful display of colors and an incredible show of knowledge."

===Exhibit of Sculpture by Donald De Lue===

In March 2021 Pickens Museum put on display 10 original sketches and the maquette for "Quest Eternal" by American sculptor Donald De Lue . “Quest Eternal” is one of De Lue’s best-known works with the 27-foot tall male figure erected in Boston in front of the Prudential Tower. Donald De Lue was the chief assistant to British sculptor Bryant Baker who created the iconic Pioneer Woman statue in Ponca City, Oklahoma. After the commission for the seventeen-foot sculpture was awarded to Baker by E.W. Marland De Lue set to work in 1928 and 1929 modeling it in Baker’s Brooklyn studio.

“Pickens Museum probably has the most complete collection of work by Donald De Lue in the world,” says Pickens. “I became interested in De Lue about 30 years ago when I learned of his role in creation of the Pioneer Woman. Our Museum now holds over forty of De Lue’s sculptures, over 100 of his original sketches, and 135 of De Lue’s original sketch books, that we have acquired over the years.”

===Mural by Robert Hardee===

Pickens Museum displays of two murals by Robert Hardee, an honorary member of the Ponca Tribe entitled “Route 66” and “Route 66 Roadhouse". “These two murals were originally commissioned for a restaurant in Ponca City and on display in their dining room,” says Hugh Pickens. “When the restaurant went out of business about 15 years ago, we had the opportunity to purchase the two murals for our collection.”

===Mural by Yatika Starr Fields===

In 2021 Pickens Museum commissioned a 20 foot by 60 foot mural by Osage Artist Yatika Starr Fields in the Cultural Engagement Center at Northern Oklahoma College. The CEC opened in 2017 and includes contemporary learning spaces where students, faculty, and/or tribal leaders can meet; individual study or collaborative projects can be conducted; culture-based learning activities and community/cultural events can be provided; professional development can be held; and small group or individual tutoring can occur.

Fields’ mural is alive with movement and filled with images that rely on vibrant colors and swirling patterns to show drums, beads, dancers, and horses. “When you dance, it’s always about movement and rhythm,” says Fields. “This is something that’s always been a part of my life. As any Native person knows who dances or participates in ceremonies, they understand that feeling of rhythm and place and movement.” That usage of movement and “swiftness” has since carried into his work, allowing it to flow from one end of the canvas to the other.

“When (NOC President) Cheryl Evans said they were looking for an artist to paint a mural for the engagement center, I immediately recommended Yatika,” says Pickens adding that Pickens Museum already has ten paintings by Fields in its permanent collection. “Yatika was delighted to have the opportunity to paint a mural that will inspire Native American students at NOC.”

===Virtual Museum at Northern Oklahoma College===

In September 2022, Northern Oklahoma College inaugurated a virtual museum at Pickens Learning Commons which shows seven web cams throughout the commons with views of the art on display in the museum.

==Pickens Museum at City Central in Ponca City==

In January, 2020 Pickens Museum opened an exhibition at City Central in Ponca City, Oklahoma titled “Winter in New York” which included three large paintings of Seventh and Eighth Avenues in New York City. The murals by Oklahoma artist Roger Disney, depict traffic near Times Square evoking the famous New Year’s Eve Ball that descends atop One Times Square.

On February 26, 2020 Pickens Museum opened an exhibition in the atrium of City Central at 400 E Central in Ponca City titled “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” which includes eight serigraphs by Faith Ringgold that depict major events in the Civil Rights Movement including “Freedom Summer” in Mississippi in 1964. “This is a opportunity for citizens of Ponca City to view art that are superlative accompaniments to Dr. King’s stirring text,” says Hugh Pickens. “The subjects and scenes that fill Ringgold’s compositions are inspired by the American experience. The themes are universal: inequality and the struggle for its eradication that should inspire us all.”

===Pioneer Woman Mural===

The Pioneer Woman mural on display in City Central was commissioned by Pickens Museum in 2015. According to Hugh Pickens, Executive Director of Pickens Museum in Ponca City, the srtist wanted to paint a mural that evoked Ponca City and “what could be more evocative of Ponca City than the Pioneer Woman.” “The primary challenge with the mural was finding a fresh approach to the subject matter,” says Pickens. “The Pioneer Woman has been done to death. It is too familiar to us in Ponca City and statewide. There have been many paintings of the Pioneer Woman over the years and its iconic power had begun to fade.” For that reason Daniel Pickens decided that the mural would consist of close-ups of the face of the Pioneer Woman from three different angles to create a new symbol of the Pioneer Woman symbol for our era. “This is a Pioneer Woman for the 21st Century.”

===Pickens Museum puts monumental sculpture on display in Ponca City===

The Ponca City News reported in September 2022 that Pickens Museum was putting the monumental bronze "Osage Warrior in the Enemy Camp” by Osage artist John Free on exhibit in Ponca City. The bronze, 12 feet long and 8 feet high, was commissioned by Pickens Museum and is on temporary display on Coppercreek in Ponca City. “I invite the public to drive by and see it,” said Hugh Pickens, Executive Director of Pickens Museum. “You can get out of your car and come over next to it if you wish to take photos but for safety reasons, please stay off the trailer.”

===World's Largest Naja Goes on Display in Ponca City===

In August, 2018 metallic sculptor Stephen Schwark put up a 20 foot Naja around the future location for Pickens Museum 2 miles west of Ponca City on Highway 60. The Naja is a traditional motif used by Navajo silversmiths as part of a squash blossom. One of the most important forms of Navajo and Southwestern Native American jewelry, is the Squash Blossom Necklace. Most are made of a string of plain round silver beads, interspersed with more stylized "squash blossoms", and feature a pendant, or "naja", hung from the center of the strand. According to the Navajo, the symbol of the Naja represents strength and protection and is held in very high esteem by the Navajo as well as other peoples.October 2022

==Pickens Museum at Woolaroc==

In August, 2022 Woolaroc Museum announced a partnership with Pickens Museum to display select pieces of fine art from the Pickens collection, including works by Native American artists Fritz Scholder, Allan Houser, and Yatika Starr Fields. “I am thrilled for Woolaroc to be able to partner with Hugh and showcase his collection here at Woolaroc,” stated Woolaroc Museum Director, Shiloh Thurman. “This partnership allows our visitors an opportunity to experience new and fresh artwork that is outside of our permanent collection on a rotational basis.” Woolaroc CEO, Kevin Hoch added, “Hugh has amassed an incredible collection of paintings, sculptures, and jewelry over the past five decades. We are proud to partner with him to diversify our guest experience and share his lifelong passion of the arts with our many supporters.”

==Exhibition in Pawhuska==

In October 2022 Pickens Museum placed the monumental sculpture "Osage Warrior in the Enemy Camp" on public exhibit between the Office of the Chiefs and the old superintendent’s house on the Osage Nation campus in Pawhuska for the sesquicentennial celebration of the founding of the Osage Reservation in Oklahoma.

[[Radius Dilworth]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Charlotte, North Carolina

Radius Dilworth is a two-tower apartment development under construction in the Dilworth neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina in the United States.

==History==

In March 2006 State Street Co announced that 615 East Morehead would be developed into a 34-story luxury condo building. The company stated that it will be a "luxurious residential high-rise".  State Street purchased the 1.5-acre site in 2002 from the Charlotte Housing Authority for $1.9 million.

The condo project was put on hold due to the recession of the 2000s.  The 1.5-acre site plus a 1.4-acre parking was listed by JLL in August 2019.  At that time the asking price was not disclosed.  However, according to most recent Mecklenburg land reevaluation the 1.5-acre site was valued at $4 million and the 1.4 acre site had a value of $3.2 million.  In December 2020, Spandrel Development Partners purchased the two parcels totaling 2.8 acre site at 615 E Morehead for $17.8 million.

The site will consist of two towers: an eight-story building of 274 apartment and a 26-story building containing 350 apartments.  The two buildings will feature 950,000 of space. The buildings will contain studio, one to three-bedroom apartments that range in size from 500 to 1,800.  They will have 40,000 of amenities which will include a fitness center, pool, and co-working space.

The Overlook building will have 5,000 of ground retail space, enough for at least two retailers.  Emanuel Neuman, Spandrel partner said, businesses like coffee shops or restaurants would be a natural fit for the neighborhood. The building will also have a 13-story parking deck with seven stories wrapped around the building.  A skybridge will connect the two buildings so that the parking deck is easily accessible from them both.

This is Spandrel Development's first project in Charlotte.  The company's second project is an apartment development near Camp North End.  The developer acquired the 19 acres for $4.4 million in September 2022 which is located at 3245 Statesville Ave.  It will be a multifamily development composed of 350 apartments

Spandrel specifically chose Charlotte because of the city's rapid growth.  The Dilworth neighborhood was picked because of its proximity to Uptown, South End, and the light rail.  The site is approximately .3 miles away from the Carson Blvd rail light station.  Radius Dilworth is a different type of development, most of Dilworth's single-family homes.  This development will be one of the first dense housing projects in Dilworth, and the tallest building in the neighborhood.   However, there are other nearby developments that are also transforming the neighborhood such as the medical innovation district called The Pearl will be about less than a mile away and the Village on Morehead across Euclid has 200 senior apartments.

[[Walker Memorial Hall, Kilbirnie]]

CATEGORIES: Government buildings completed in 1916, City chambers and town halls in Scotland

The Walker Memorial Hall is a municipal building in Main Street, Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The structure is currently used as the offices for various local community groups as well as for the local Citizens Advice Bureau.

==History==

Following the death of the local doctor, William Walker, in 1885, a local friendly society, The Thistle Lodge of Free Gardeners, decided to commission a statue in his honour. The statue, which was sculpted by David Watson Stevenson, depicted a female figure of the Greek goddess, Hygieia, on a plinth. On the west side of the plinth was a carved bust depicting Walker himself. The statue was unveiled outside Walker's home, Walkerstone House, in Main Street on 16 June 1894.

In the early 20th century, Walker's son, who was also a doctor and named William, wrote to parish council from his home Buenos Aires enclosing a donation of £4,000 for the benefit of the people of Kilbirnie. The parish council decide to use the money to erect a complex containing council offices and a public hall on a site in Main Street. The new building was designed by Robert James Walker of Glasgow in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone at a cost of £5,200 and was officially opened in the presence of the chairman of the parish council, John Riddet, on 9 September 1916.

The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of four bays facing onto Main Street. The outer bays, which were slightly projected forward, featured doorways flanked by pilasters and brackets supporting entablatures surmounted by segmental pediments. The left-hand entablature was inscribed with the words "Council Offices" while the right-hand entablature was inscribed with the words "Public Hall". The outer bays were fenestrated by single sash windows on the first floor, while the inner bays were fenestrated by pairs of sash windows on both floors. The outer bays were flanked by full-height pilasters supporting an entablature inscribed with the words "Walker Memorial Hall". At roof level, there was a parapet which was balustraded above the inner bays. Internally, the principal room was the main assembly hall.

In 1931, the parish council acquired an adjacent building, the Imperial Hotel, creating additional kitchen facilities for the memorial hall as well as living accommodation for its caretaker. Alterations were also made to the main assembly hall to a design by James Houston at that time, and then to a design by Houston and his son, James Brodie Gilmour Houston, in 1964. These two sets of alterations substantially extended the main assembly hall enabling it to accommodate 820 people seated. In the 1960s, it was used a concert venue: notable performers at that time include Gerry and the Pacemakers, Bill Haley & His Comets and Dusty Springfield.

Following the completion of an extensive refurbishment, which cost £100,000 and was financed by North Ayrshire Council, the building re-opened as the offices for various local community groups and for the local Citizens Advice Bureau in February 2017.

The McAllen Palms were a minor league baseball team based in McAllen, Texas. In 1931, the Palms played as members of the Class D level Rio Grande Valley League, winning the league championship in a shortened season.

==History==

The Palms were preceded in minor league play by the 1928 "McAllen" team, which played the season as members of the Class D level Texas Valley League.

The McAllen "Palms" began play in 1931. The four–team, Class D level Rio Grande Valley League began the season with the Corpus Christi Seahawks, Harlingen Ladds and San Benito Saints joining McAllen in beginning league play on April 22, 1931. On June 4, 1931, Corpus Christi moved to become the La Feria Nighthawks.

The "Palms" nickname corresponds to local agriculture in the era. Palm trees became prevalent in the area and were harvested. McAllen is nicknamed as "The City of Palms."

During its first season of league play, the Rio Grande Valley League folded on July 30, 1931, with the Palms in first place. Despite folding, the league held finals that featured McAllen vs. La Feria. The Palms were in first place overall when the league folded, finishing the 1931 overall regular season with a record of 55–37, playing under manager Tex Covington. McAllen won the first-half pennant and finished 7.5 games ahead of the Seahawks/Nighthawks in the final overall standings. The Palms played La Feria in a playoff, after the Nighthawks won the second–half title in the split–schedule season. In the 1931 finals, the McAllen Palms swept La Feria in three games.

Harry Bonds of McAllen led the Rio Grande Valley League with eight home runs, while teammate Frank Denson led the league with 70 stolen bases, 109 total hits and 99 runs scored. Palms pitcher Horace Hardy led the league with an 11–3 record.

Following the 1931 season, the Rio Grande Valley League did not return to play in 1932. McAllen next hosted the 1938 McAllen Packers, who played as members of the Class D level Texas Valley League, which reformed after a nine–season hiatus.

Selena Sturmay (born June 21, 1998) is a Canadian curler from Edmonton, Alberta. She currently skips her own team out of the Saville Community Sports Centre.

==Career==

Sturmay made her first appearance at the Canadian Junior Curling Championships in 2016, skipping her team of Dacey Brown, Megan Moffat and Hope Sunley out of Airdrie. She qualified for the national championship by making a runback double takeout to defeat Kayla Skrlik in the championship game. After a 4–2 round robin record, her team finished 6–4 in the championship pool, placing fifth.

Sturmay and her brother Karsten represented Alberta at the 2018 Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship. There, the pair went 3–4 in the round robin, not enough to qualify for the playoff round. Also in 2018, she was part of the Kristen Streifel rink that won the U Sports/Curling Canada University Curling Championships, qualifying for the 2019 Winter Universiade. There, Team Streifel, representing the University of Alberta, led Canada to a 7–2 round robin record, qualifying for the playoffs. They then lost to Great Britain's Sophie Jackson in the quarterfinals 6–4, settling for fifth.

Sturmay won her second provincial junior title in 2019 skipping a new team of Abby Marks, Kate Goodhelpsen and Paige Papley. At the 2019 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, she would find much more success, posting an undefeated 10–0 record through the round robin and championship pools. This qualified her team for the final where they faced British Columbia's Sarah Daniels. After a tied 6–6 game through eight ends, the Alberta team scored three in the ninth end, going on to win the game by a 9–6 score. The win earned her team the right to represent Canada at the 2019 World Junior Curling Championships, where they qualified for the playoffs with a 6–3 record. They then beat Switzerland's Raphaela Keiser in the semifinal to qualify for the final against Russia's Vlada Rumiantseva. Holding the hammer in the extra end, Sturmay's threw her final draw heavy, giving up a steal of one and the win to the Russian team. Also during the 2018–19 season, she led the Alberta Pandas to a 4–3 record at the University championship, not qualifying for the playoffs.

The following season, Sturmay aged out of juniors and formed a new team with Chantele Broderson, Goodhelpsen and Lauren Marks. The team did not have a successful season, failing to qualify for the playoffs in any of their tour events and not reaching the 2020 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts. She was, however, able to secure her second U Sport title at the 2020 U Sports/Curling Canada University Curling Championships, skipping the Alberta Pandas to a 10–2 victory over Justine Comeau's UNB Reds team in the final game.

After joining the Kayla Skrlik rink at third for the abbreviated 2020–21 season, Sturmay returned to skipping her own team of former teammates Abby Marks, Catherine Clifford, Paige Paley and Kate Goodhelpsen for the 2021–22 season. The team was able to find success on tour, reaching the final of the Alberta Curling Series: Avonair spiel and the semifinals of the Red Deer Curling Classic and the Alberta Curling Series: Thistle event respectively. They also qualified for the 2022 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts, where they finished in seventh place with a 2–5 record. The team ended their season at the Alberta Curling Tour Championship where they defeated Team Skrlik 9–2 in the championship game. Sturmay did not play in the team's final event, however. Additionally, Sturmay spared for Team Skrlik at the 2022 Best of the West event where they went 1–2, missing the playoffs.

Team Sturmay began the 2022–23 season at the 2022 Alberta Curling Series: Event 1 where they lost in the final to South Korea's Gim Eun-ji. In September, they were invited to compete in the 2022 PointsBet Invitational due to ranking thirteenth in the CTRS standings. They were able to upset Chelsea Carey in the opening round before losing to eventual champions Jennifer Jones in the quarterfinal round.

==Personal life==

Sturmay is employed as a registered nurse for the Alberta Health Services. She is married to Keaton Boyd.

Emmeline Deane (1858 – 1944) was a British portrait painter.  

Emmeline Deane was born in Bath, one of thirteen children of the Rev. John Bathurst Deane, a South African-born English clergyman and author, and Louisa Deane, daughter of Sealy Fourdrinier.  Her siblings included novelist Mary Bathurst Deane and Eleanor Deane Wodehouse, mother of author P. G. Wodehouse.

Deane trained at the Académie Julian in Paris.  She exhibited numerous times at the Royal Academy between 1879 and 1892. Her works include a portrait of Cardinal John Henry Newman, her first cousin once removed, that is in the National Portrait Gallery and a celebrated portrait of painter Anna Bilińska, her classmate in Paris, in mourning dress that is in the Victoria Art Gallery. Bilińska's portrait, depicting the artist in deep mourning, was painted by Deane in Paris shortly after Bilińska's father died in 1882. This painting evoked such emotional intensity of loss that, when exhibited in Paris and London, it "caused such a stir that it featured in a cartoon in Punch magazine." The work is considered to be significant because it was not common, at that time, for women painters to create formal salon-style portraits of other women painters, let alone to exhibit them.

Emmeline Deane died in 1944 in Uxbridge.

Phyllis Kinney (born 4 July 1922) is an American-born singer, collector and historian who is a leading authority on Welsh folk music. She studied at the Juilliard School and was a soprano with the Carl Rosa Opera Company during the 1940s. After meeting her husband Meredydd Evans, Kinney immersed herself in the culture of Wales. Through her writing, research and performances, Kinney helped to preserve and promote traditional music of Wales. The archives of Kinney and Evans are now part of the Welsh Music Archive at the National Library of Wales.

==Career==

Kinney was born in Pontiac, Michigan on 4 July 1922, Independence Day. After completing her education at Pontiac High School, Kinney enrolled at Michigan State College, East Lansing. There, she was tutored in music by Gomer Llewelyn Jones, a Welshman who had moved to America in 1934. Jones sparked in interest in Welsh music in Kinney, who later said she had "hardly heard of Wales" before meeting him. By 1942, Kinney was giving public performances of Welsh songs, assisted by Jones at the piano. Jones considered her soprano renditions to bring "a vivid understanding of the character of the Welsh people" to audiences in Michigan. Kinney graduated in 1943 and secured a fellowship at the Juilliard School, New York City.

In 1947, Kinney became lead solo with the Carl Rosa Opera Company. With the company, she toured the UK in March of that year. During a stop in Bangor, Wales, Kinney met Meredydd Evans, a Welsh folk musician who was a member of the popular close harmony group Triawd y Coleg. Kinney learnt to speak, read and write Welsh, and introduced Evans to folk music from around the world. The couple married on 10 April 1948 and had a daughter, Eluned, in 1949.

Like Evans, Kinney began to work for the BBC, often performing duets with her husband. Kinney sang in "impeccable Welsh, which had a delightful American burr occasionally", according to the Western Mail. In June 1952, the family moved to America, where Evans enrolled at Princeton University. In 1960, the family moved back to Wales, where they settled. With Evans, Kinney edited collections of Welsh songs described as "definitive reference-works for this genre of national song." In 1962, Kinney providing operatic vocal accompaniment on Evans' album A Concert of Welsh Songs, with backing by the Russian harpist Maria Korchinska and several musicians and singers conducted and arranged by Robert Docker. Kinney later described the album, Evans' first to use instrumental backing, as "tradition dressed up to suit the audience".

In the 1980s, Kinney and Evans settled in Cwmystwyth, where they contributed to the community and taught Welsh to a host of their non-Welsh-speaking neighbours; according to biographer R. Arwel Jones, the couple's home became "a magnet for people of all ages, from all over Wales and the world who would flock there to enjoy their company and to benefit from the couple's intellectual generosity". Their home's proximity to the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth allowed the couple to devote their retirement to studying the history of folk songs and tunes, and their research appeared regularly in Canu Gwerin, the journal of the Welsh Folk Song Society. Kinney was awarded an honorary M Mus degree by the University of Wales in 1991 and became honorary fellow of Bangor University alongside her husband in 1997. In April 2007, the University of Wales published a Festschrift volume for Evans and Kinney, "a fully bilingual collection of critical essays on various aspects of Welsh song and traditional music by Wales’ leading experts and musicologists" to celebrate their contribution "not only to Welsh traditional music but to the very culture and language of Wales."

In 2011, University of Wales Press published Kinney's final book to date, Welsh Traditional Music, an extensive history and analysis of the instrumental and vocal traditions of Wales.

Meredydd Evans died aged 95 in 2015; he and Kinney had arranged to donate their archives to the National Library of Wales, where they are now part of the Welsh Music Archive. In 2019, Kinney and Evans were awarded the Welsh Music Prize Inspiration Award.

Kinney turned 100 on 4 July 2022. On that date, the National Library hosted Phyllis Kinney: 100, an event featuring her daughter Eluned and harpist Elinor Bennett, to celebrate the centenary.

Medora Gordon Byron (1782–1858) has long been accepted as the pseudonym of "Miss Byron," a Romantic-era author of either five or eight novels, though recent scholarship has complicated that identification.

==Life==

Nothing is known of Medora Gordon Byron. She has been tentatively, but not conclusively, identified as Julia Maria Byron. There are two sets of novels which have been traditionally attributed to Medora Gordon Byron, five published under the name "Miss Byron" and three under the pseudonym "A Modern Antique." Both groups of novels were brought out by the notorious Minerva Press, a highly successful London publisher of Gothic, sensation, and other popular genres. Susan Brown et al. writes that "both strings of fiction are exclamatory in style, interested in domesticity, and latterly in the unmarried (both men and women), given sometimes to commentary on novel-writing." Twenty-first century experts, however, maintain that it is unlikely that the same person authored both series.

An author by the same name was credited with a musical melodrama in 1834, as well as a poem, though critics maintain that this cannot be the same author.

One of the eight novels—Celia in Search of a Husband—is available in a modern edition, one of the Chawton House Library series of Women's Novels. Three others are freely accessible in digitized versions and others are available by paid license. A critic who has written about The English-Woman, the earliest of Byron's publications, characterizes the writing in that novel as "mediocre," though the fact that it went into a second edition would indicate at least a modest level of success. The "Modern Antique" persona has been described as conservative and a moralist, yet also as the author of the "high-spirited and entertaining ... anti-Jacobin" Celia in Search of a Husband. The literary quality is not what interests recent scholars, however, but rather Byron's role as a professional woman writer, such as her use of "multiple authorial identities," a strategy she shared with Ann Hatton and Elizabeth Meeke, both of whom also published with Minerva.

[[Claude de Savoie]]

CATEGORIES: 1507 births, 1566 deaths, French people of the French Wars of Religion

Claude de Savoie (1507–1566) was a French governor and commander. Son of René of Savoy, Tende's career would begin at a young age, fighting at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. He served extensively throughout the later Italian Wars in particular holding a key role in the Italian War of 1536–1538 and the dauphins invasion of Roussillon. During this time he would establish himself as a moderate religious presence, keen to achieve compromise and avoid the brutality that typified the Massacre of Mérindol perpetrated by one of his subordinates in 1545. With the outbreak of civil war in 1562, his son Sommerive rallied the Catholics of Provence against him, and successfully drove him into exile. Restored to his office in 1563, he would lead the region for another 3 years before dying in 1566.

==Early life and family==

Claude de Savoie was the eldest son of René of Savoy and Anne Lascaris, born on 27 March 1507.

Marriage negotiations took place between Tende and Adrienne d'Estouteville who refused to honour the contract, noting he had 'a bad odor' and 'kept the company of many women.' Tende for his part resented the prospect of renouncing his title that the contract would have involved. Frustrated at the failure of this match, Lascaris arranged a contract for Tende to marry Marie de Chabannes daughter of Jacques de Chabannes the governor of Bourbonnais. The contract was sealed in 1534. Anne, who held the title of Tende, Limon, Vernant and Loubet reserved rights to hold the titles formally until her death. He had a son with Marie, named Henri, however he did not reach adulthood. In 1538 Chabannes gave birth to a second son, Sommerive, however the birth would have fatal complications for the mother.

In 1539 Tende re-married, to Françoise de Foix-Candalle with whom he had a third son, the baron de Cipières. Françoise was Protestant, and she instilled her faith in their younger son and sympathies in her husband. Sommerive by contrast remained Catholic in opposition to the remainder of his family.

His mother passed away in 1554, and with her passing, he inherited the lordship of Tende.

==Reign of François I==

===Entry to politics===

In 1520 Tende was provided with the office of gentleman of the chamber' and later in that year his father presented him to the estates of Provence, which had assembled in Aix. René arranged for the relinquishing of his office of grand-seneschal in favour of his son while maintaining the title of governor of Provence for himself. At the age of seventeen he fought alongside his father at the Battle of Pavia and was taken prisoner. Ransomed for 30,000 écus he returned from captivity shortly after the death of his father. Upon René's death he assumed the roles of lieutenant-general and governor of Provence alongside his responsibilities as Admiral of the Levant Sea. In his capacity as Admiral he accompanied Marguerite for the negotiations that formed the Treaty of Madrid (1526).

In 1527 Lascaris mediated a dispute between Tende and his brother Villars by which Tende ceded 800 tournais pounds of income in exchange for Villars renouncing his rights to the Tende inheritance, further agreement was reached to exchange some land holdings relating to the barony of Pressigny and the county of Sommerive.

===Invasion of Naples===

Tende accompanied Lautrec on his invasion of Naples in 1529, and after the death of the captain of the Swiss regiments, was recommended as their new leader by Marshal Lautrec. Disease was destroying the French expedition, and when he returned to France Tende was very sick and took time in Lyons to recover. When Montmorency marched south to Bayonne to negotiate the release of the king's sons from Spanish captivity in 1530, Tende accompanied the diplomatic mission. In 1532 François elevated him to the Order of Saint Michael. The following year he was responsible for bringing the duchess of Urbino to France so that she might marry Orléans. To divide his responsibilities he established a separate office holder as lieutenant-general, choosing the seigneur de Puy-Martin.

===Invasion of Provence===

In 1536 Charles V invaded Provence with 60,000 men. Tende coordinated defence of the province from Aix, overseeing the defences for the city. The king established a strategy of creating no-mans lands so that Charles might be sapped of supplies, as a result those in the villages of Provence were ordered to bring all their livestock from the fields. Tende determined the city of Grasse untenable due to defects in its walls, and ordered it put to the torch. The emperor meanwhile had seized several towns across the Var. Tende was conscious he lacked the forces to impede the emperor and organised a retreat, leaving forces in the mountains around Grasse to harry their advance. The scorched earth policy continued as Tende retreated deeper into Provence. The brutal policy had its intended effect, after failing to siege Marseilles, and with his army disintegrating Charles was forced to retreat from Provence, crossing the Var again in September.

As the war continued, Tende accompanied the king in his entry to Piedmont, before a truce was agreed, and then peace in 1538. The terms of the peace were brokered in the lands of Provence, and Tende was responsible for transporting the parties to the location.

Around this time Tende fell out with the Parlement of Aix, unwilling to sanction their judgement against the village of Mérindol. Those in Mérindol would be exterminated in 1545. The deed was carried out by the new lieutenant-general of Provence, the comte de Grignan. With war resumed in 1541, Tende accompanied the dauphin on his campaign into Roussillon. After a failed siege of Perpignan Tende returned to his government in 1542.

==Reign of Henri II==

Between 1549-1559 Tende sought to repair much of the damage that the ravages of war had done to his governorship in the prior year. He remained in good favour with the new king, with whom he had served in prior years, and for which he was granted the seigniory of Mujoulx. In 1554, wary of the movements of the duke of Savoy, Tende had forces camped at Mougins, observing their movements. Much of the most recent outbreak of war would however occur in northern France, and as a result his role was limited. He continued to coordinate with Brissac and the Turkish navy for potential operations against Nice as the king desired to capture the city.

==Reign of François II==

Around this time dispute arose between the Protestant Antoine de Mauvans and the Parlement of Aix, Tende tried to mediate the dispute, as he had attempted at Mérindol, however Mauvans would be assassinated. Paulon de Mauvans swore vengeance for the killing of his brother, and began a campaign of terror across the countryside. Tende, urged to confront him by the court and local grandees, raised an army of 5000, and advanced on the rebellious noble. Finding him in his stronghold, Tende's instinct to negotiate arose, and he successfully convinced Mauvans that his conscience would not be infringed if he would disband his army and retire to a private life. He was able to inform Guise in November that 'everything is quiet in Provence.

==Reign of Charles IX==

===Breakdown of order===

The quiet would however be a temporary illusion, shattered by the death of François II in December. Tende was attacked by the court for his soft approach to dealing with heresy. In particular Catherine wrote to him noting his failure to deal with the violence in Aix and urging him to make an example of those who cause disorder. Tende attempted to work with the Parlement of Aix to avoid a massacre of the towns Protestant population, but they were uninterested in acting against the perpetrators. The governor of Aix, Flassans led a vigilante organisation of militant Catholics that attacked Protestants. Tende worked with de Crussol in his opposition to Flassans.

===First civil war===

Tende entered the field against Flassans in early 1562, defeating his forces near Aix. To assist him against Flassans, Tende was working with Mauvans, who, upon capturing the base of Flassans support at Barjols perpetrated a massacre. Tende sent his son-in-law Jacques de Cardé to put a stop to it, however by the time he arrived in the town it was all over. Flassans brother Carcès reorganised the group on the lines of a ligue and reached out to form an alliance with Tende's son, Sommerive against him in May 1562. Sommerive began raising taxes, and explained to the notables of Provence that Tende was a prisoner of the Protestants, and as such his orders could safely be ignored. Together Sommerive and Carcès took the towns of Aix and Marseille from Tende, and in late 1562 drive him into exile in Savoy. In November the Parlement of Aix recognised Sommerives usurpation of power, declaring him the governor of Provence in lieu of Tende.

===Making the peace===

With the Edict of Amboise ending hostilities in Provence, much disorder remaining in the region. The provincial estates refused to accept Protestant worship despite the terms of the peace, and the Parlement' refused to register it. Their defiance, in combination with the continued presence of armed Protestant militia's in the region, persuaded the royal court to send Biron south with several commissioners and 500 soldiers. He reduced the Protestant garrison of Sisteron, persuaded the Catholic nobility to get into line with the edict, and re-installed Tende as governor of Provence, returning him from exile to Marseille. The Parlement would prove tenacious in its opposition however and in November 1563 the most militant members were suspended and replaced with judges from Paris.

===Death===

Despite the rebellion of his son against him, in determining his inheritance, he maintained that it was right his eldest son inherit his lands, noting 'the ingratitude and disobedience of Honorat, our eldest son, whose youth and bad judgement pitted him against us, as everyone knows, to our great regret and displeasure, which would justify disinheriting him if we wished to'.

Shah Sultan Ahmad Nanupuri (শাহ সুলতান আহমদ নানুপুরী; 26 June 1914 – 16 August 1997), also known by his daak naam Badshah, was a Bangladeshi Islamic scholar, teacher and author. He established numerous madrasas in Bangladesh and was the founding principal of Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiah Obaidia Nanupur for seventeen years.

==Early life and family==

Shah Sultan Ahmad was born on 26 June 1914, to a Bengali Muslim family in the village of Dharmapur, located under the Fatikchhari subdivision of the Bengal Province's Chittagong District. His father, Shah Fazlur Rahman, worked in Rangoon, British Burma and his mother, Umdah Khatun, was a housewife. His grandfather's great-grandfather, Akbar Shah, migrated from Arabia to Bengal via Afghanistan for dawah and permanently settled there. Among Fazlur Rahman's children, it was only him that did not die during childhood. When he was roughly two and a half years old, his mother died as a result of a cholera outbreak.

==Education==

Sultan Ahmad's education began at a local maktab ran by Ubaydul Haq Mianji. When he reached the age of five, he joined the Garzania Primary School. After his father's instruction, he later joined the Himayah al-Islam Madrasa in Nanupur Kalu Munshirhat. There he began studying from Yazdaham to Jamate Shashum under the likes of Lal Miyan, Obaydul Hoque and Muhammad Faizullah.

In his final year, his father died. After completing his studies, his stepmother advised him to join the Darul Uloom Alia Madrasa in the city of Chittagong. Ahmad stayed there for a few months but did not enjoy the curriculum, and so returned home. Being influenced by his former teachers, he intended to re-enrol from Jamate Shashum at the Darul Uloom Deoband. He therefore travelled to Saharanpur in Hindustan to complete his studies in Deoband. He also briefly studied at the nearby Mazahir Uloom, before graduating (MA) from the faculty of Hadith studies at Darul Uloom Deoband and beginning his philosophy course.  Among his teachers were Hussain Ahmad Madani, Izaz Ali Amrohi, Ibrahim Baliyavi, Zahur Ahmed, Habibullah Mirathi and Riyaz ad-Din.

==Career==

During his studies in Deoband, Nanupuri served as an imam at the Deoband Central Mosque. After graduating and returning to Bengal, he sent a letter to join the faculty at the Al-Jamia al-Arabia Nasirul Islam in Nazirhat Bazar and was accepted to teach there. The erstwhile principal of the madrasa, Nur Ahmad, later employed Zafar Ahmad Usmani too. Usmani was a supporter of the All-India Muslim League, whilst Nanupuri strongly believed that religious institutions like the madrasa should be free from political influence. Nanupuri subsequently left and became a teacher at Al-Jamiatul Islamiah Azizul Uloom Babunagar for 15 years. Azizul Haq later instructed Nanupuri to become the acting principal, and later the founding principal of Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiah Obaidia Nanupur in 1961. He served in Nanupur for seventeen years in total, and then gave up the role to Zamiruddin Nanupuri. Among his notable students were Abdur Rahman Chatgami, Muhibbullah Babunagari and Sultan Zauq Nadvi.

Among the other madrasas that he established are Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiyyah Bayt al-Huda and Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiyyah Azizul Uloom Pokkhali. He was also the founder of the Ar-Rashid monthly magazine.

==Personal life==

During his education in Deoband, Nanupuri spent seven years under Hussain Ahmad Madani, pledging bay'ah to Madani on 18 November 1944. However, after the Partition of India in 1947, Nanupuri was unable to maintain a close relationship with Madani, and could not meet with Ashraf Ali Thanwi either as he was ill. Madani responded to Nanupuri in a letter giving him permission to master tasawuuf under a different Sufi scholar. Nanupuri then became a murid of Azizul Haq of Patiya, and received khilafah (spiritual succession) from him after 15 years.

Nanupuri first completed Hajj with his pir, Azizul Haq. In 1967, a businessman named Niamat Ali Sawdagar funded Nanupuri for Hajj. His third hajj took place in 1970, alongside Mohammed Younus and Abdur Rahman Chatgami. His fourth and last hajj was in 1991, alongside Mufti Said Ahmad (founder of Jamia Sultania Lalpol) and Afsar Ahmad (Qari of Nanupur Madrasa).

On 21 January 1945, Nanupuri married Momena Khatun, the first daughter of Munshi Abdul Khaliq. They had four sons and six daughters, although two sons died at an early stage. His son, Imdadullah Nanupuri, is also an Islamic scholar and the principal of Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiyyah Bayt al-Huda.

==Death and legacy==

Nanupuri died on 16 August 1997 in his own room at Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiah Obaidia Nanupur, after being ill for three years. The next day, Ali Ahmad Boalvi led his janaza at the Nanupur Madrasa courtyard. Nanupuri's elder son Hussain Ahmad Nanupuri was unable to participate as he was in the United Arab Emirates at the time and so when he returned, Nanupuri's younger son Imdadullah Nanupuri led a second funeral prayer. After the prayer, Nanupuri was buried in the Maqbara-e-Sultania.

Nanupuri's leading khalifah (spiritual successor) Said Ahmad established a madrasa in Feni named after him as Al-Jamiah al-Islamiyyah as-Sultaniyyah. He also wrote a biography on his teacher titled "Shah Sultan Ahmad Nanupuri's life and teachings" which was published by the Hakimul Ulama Foundation Bangladesh. Shah Ahmad Ghani also wrote a biography on Nanupuri, and Abdul Majid Muhajir-e-Makki wrote an eleven-volume Urdu biography titled "Marif-e-Sultan". Abdus Salam Chatgami later edited the work and published it in two volumes. His disciples have founded numerous institutions and organisations in his name such as the Allama Shah Sultan Ahmad Foundation Bangladesh, and his speeches have been collected and published. In 2018, Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiyyah Bayt al-Huda began publishing a seasonal magazine named after him as the Samayiki As-Sultan. Among his other biographies are:

[[Albert Henry Smyth]]

CATEGORIES: 1863 births, 1907 deaths, American historians, Burials at West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Central High School (Philadelphia) alumni, Educators from Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin

Albert Henry Smyth (June 18, 1863 – May 4, 1907) was a professor of history, writer, English teacher, editor, and a member and curator for the American Philosophical Society. Smyth is widely noted among historians for editing and publishing the papers of Benjamin Franklin, including hundreds of letters and papers he discovered in private collections in America and Europe which had never before been published, with many involving Franklin's scientific pursuits, and for also restoring original spelling and grammar used by Franklin, which was sometimes changed and published by a previous editor, before he published his ten-volume work of Franklin's papers in 1905–1907.

==Early life and education==

Smyth was born  on June 18, 1863, in Philadelphia. Little is known of his boy-hood days. His parents were William Clarke Smyth and Adelaide (Suplee) Smyth. He attended the public schools in Philadelphia and graduated from Central High School in 1882. In 1887 Smyth became a professor of English literature at Central High.

==Career==

For two years Smyth worked for various local newspapers, and some time as assistant librarian in the Mercantile Library in Philadelphia, from 1884 to 1885. In 1885  he functioned cataloging books at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., where he had the opportunity to enroll in various seminar courses, and in February 1887 received a Bachelor of Arts degree (extra ordinem). For his Master's thesis he wrote, Shakespeare's Pericles and Apollonius of Tyre which was a study in Comparative Literature. Smyth's thesis was read before the American Philosophical Society and was printed in volume thirty-seven of the Society's journal, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. When it was reprinted in I898, it received much praise from Shakespearean critics in America and Europe, and is considered a "monument of his learning and critical ability".

In  1883-1884  he was the editor and publisher of  Shakespeariana,  a monthly magazine,  which  became  widely acclaimed among  Shakespearian scholars. In May,  1886, he was a professor of English  literature in  the  Philadelphia Central High School and in 1895 he became the department head of the English language and literature curriculum.

On May 20, 1887, Smyth was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society where he was constantly active and served as its curator. It was at the Society where he became familiar with their enormous collection of Benjamin Franklin's papers. Smyth was also elected  to  membership  many prominent scientific societies in  America. During his research he discovered many missing leaflets to existing letters from Benjamin Franklin and was able to restore many mutilated pages. 

In 1887 Smyth represented the American Philosophical Society  in Glasgow, Scotland, and delivered a Latin oration at the celebration at Glasgow University's forty-fifth anniversary.

Smyth was also an admirer of Bayard Taylor, an accomplished poet and writer who lived in Philadelphia. In his 1896 biography of Taylor, Smyth gives a definitive account of Taylor's literary career.

===Benjamin Franklin's papers===

From 1905 to 1907 Smyth, under the auspices of the American Philosophical Society, was the editor of Benjamin Franklin's many letters and manuscripts, and edited and published 385 lost letters and other works that had never before been published. They are included in a ten volume work, entitled The writings of Benjamin Franklin. Smyth, like editors John Bigelow and Jared Sparks before him worked individually, with limited financial resources, unlike the editors involved with the latest on-going publication from APS and Yale who have the benefit of generous financial support for such an involved and large project. In the preface of volume one he assures his readers that,

Smyth included an index which is considered "so complete and exhaustive" that it allows researches and historians easy inquiry into many of items outlined in Franklin's wide range of writings, i.e. under subject, place, correspondent or event. Included among the various writings are Smyth's comprehensive footnotes, touching on related history and many of Franklin's correspondents.

Smyth's editorial efforts and publication of Franklin's papers are considered his greatest work and as an important tribute to Franklin's 200th anniversary of birth, and has been acclaimed and well received by the American Philosophical Society, founded by Franklin, and by other societies he founded. The ten volumes of The Writings of Benjamin Franklin is expected to be a "lasting monument" of Professor Smyth's research and persistent efforts. He discovered new material in America and in Europe consisting of 385 letters and 40 papers, all in Franklin's hand, which were never before printed by any previous editor. Smyth corrected more than two thousand errors that occurred in earlier editions, and restored much of the text that was altered by Jared Sparks in his mistaken notion that he was improving Franklin's racy and dynamic English.

Smyth discovered new material in private and public collections, and in those recently acquired by the Library of the University of Pennsylvania, as well as in public archives on both sides of the Atlantic. He also located papers that were in the collections which had never before been consulted by any previous editor of Franklin's writings. He gave a complete  account of the damaged papers due to age and neglect, which are now in safe keeping  in the Library of the American Philosophical Society, Library of Congress  and in the library of the University of Pennsylvania.

John Bigelow, one of the leading authorities on Franklin in his day, and the man who rescued Franklin's original manuscript of his famous Autobiography from obscurity, wrote of Professor Smyth's work and effort on Franklin's papers, " The development of the scientific side of Franklin will be new to the general reader, and the lack of it was perhaps the most conspicuous deficiency to all previous collections." Franklin biographer Walter Isaacson notes that until The Papers of Benjamin Franklin began and continues to be published by Yale University and the American Philosophical Society, beginning in  1954, and expected to reach some 47 volumes, Smyth's ten-volume work was the leading definitive collection of Franklin's papers.

==Final days and legacy==

Devoting his life to literary and cultural pursuits, Smyth never married.  In 1906 Smyth traveled abroad to Paris where he was decorated with the insignia of the Legion of Honor by the French government when he spoke with "marked distinction" as the representative of the United States at a dedication of a statue of Franklin. He had intended to author the life of Franklin and to edit the writings of George Washington. He died, however, on May 4, 1907, in Germantown, Pennsylvania, at the relatively early age of 43 from Bright's disease (nephritis). On May 7 Joseph Rosengarten on behalf of The American Philosophical Association paid a tribute to Smyth by reading a Treatise of his life and involvement as a historian and member of the Association noting that, "His services to this Society were constant and valuable." Smyth's last completed work was his edited edition of The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, published in 1907, just after his death. In the preface, Smyth, as a former teacher, praises Franklin's autobiography in that, "It contains lessons of wisdom and encouragement, and it should be an inspiration to every youthful reader."

A portrait of Smyth painted by James B. Sword, hangs on display at the Central High School in Philadelphia.

[[Bolonha Mansion]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Belém, Houses in Brazil, State heritage sites of Pará

The Bolonha Mansion (Palacete Bolonha) is a historic residence in Belém, Pará, Brazil. It was built between 1905 and 1908 by the architect Francisco Bolonha (1872-1939) as a gift to his wife Alice Tem-Brink; he is also noted as the father of the modernist architect Francisco de Paula Lemos Bolonha. Bolonha was travelled extensively to Europe, and his works were greatly influence by Gustave Eiffel. The Bolonha Palace is a strong example of eclectic architecture in Brazil. It was listed as a historic structure by the Department of Historic, Artistic and Cultural Heritage of Pará in 1982.

==History==

Numerous residential buildings appeared in the city of Belém during the "Rubber Cycle" in the Amazon. Wealthy merchants and politicians built properties, typically called "palaces" along with the name of the family: Bolonha, Faciola, Pinho, Montenegro, Virgilio Sampaio, and others. Many were demolished due to real estate speculation in the mid- and late-20th century. The mansions formed a nucleus of both political power and social life in Belém of the period. They were used as a "stage" for the elites of Pará, hosting dinners, balls, and recitals.

The Bolonha Mansion, while richly decorated, proved impractical. The house had little ventilation, and was vacated a few years after the death of Francisco Bolonha in 1939.

==Location==

The Bolonha Mansion was built in a prestigious location on Rua de São Jerônimo (now Avenida Governador José Malcher) at the intersection of Rua Dr. Moraes. The mansion is east of the historic center of Pará, and a short distance from the Praça da República, a broad public square. Bolonha arranged his mansion and the houses of his family along the narrow, sloping Passagem Bolonha with "Neoclassical symmetry".

==Structure==

The Bolonha Mansion consists of three floors with a belvedere. The residence was decorated with a profusion of themes and materials: Art Nouveau tiles, Greek and Roman-themed reliefs, reproductions of Pompeiian mosaics, and multichromatic glass and tiled flooring. The gilded stucco work was executed by Newton Sá.

==Protected status==

The Montenegro Mansion was listed as a historic structure by the Department of Historic, Artistic and Cultural Heritage of the state of Pará in 1982.

The McAllen Giants were a minor league baseball franchise based in McAllen, Texas. In 1949 and 1950, the Giants played as members of the Class D level Rio Grande Valley League, hosting home games at Paris Field. The Giants qualified for the 1949 playoffs, before finishing last in 1950, which proved to be the final season of the league.

==History==

The Giants were preceded by the 1938 McAllen Packers, who played as members of the Class D level Texas Valley League, reforming after a nine–season hiatus.

In 1949, McAllen returned to play in the Rio Grande Valley League, which reformed. The 1931 McAllen Palms won the Rio Grande Valley League championship in the leagues' previous season of play.

The McAllen "Giants" joined the six-team Class D level Rio Grande Valley League, with the Brownsville Charros, Corpus Christi Aces, Del Rio Cowboys, Donna Cardinals and Laredo Apaches beginning league play with McAllen on April 27, 1949. The McAllen Giants were owned by Earl Long.

In their first season of play, the 1949 McAllen Giants qualified for the four-team Rio Grande Valley League playoffs. The Giants placed fourth in the regular season standings, with a record of 70–68, playing the season under managers Fran Matthews and Phil Kuykendall. McAllen finished 18.0 games behind the 1st place Corpus Christi Aces in the final standings. In the playoffs, McAllen was swept in four games by Corpus Christi in the first round. McAllen pitcher Edward Arthur led the league with 198 strikeouts and teammate Harold Jackson had a 20-8 record, the best in the league.

In 1950, the Rio Grande Valley league became a Class C level league to begin the season, as the league expanded to eight teams. However, the Robstown Rebels and Donna-Weslaco Twins teams folded during the season, leaving six remaining teams. The league would not return to play in 1951.

The 1950 McAllen Giants finished a distant last in the Rio Grande Valley league final standings. With an average player age of 22.7, the Giants were by far the youngest team in the league. The Giants had a final record of 42–102, finishing 42.0 games behind the first place Harlingen Capitols and 33.5 games behind the fifth place Del Rio Cowboys. Managed by Boyd SoRelle and the returning Phil Kuykendall, McAllen did not qualify for the 1950 playoffs.

The Rio Grande Valley league did not return to play in 1951 and permanently folded. McAllen next hosted minor league baseball, with the 1977 McAllen Dusters, who played the season as members of the short lived Class A level Lone Star League.

==The ballpark==

The McAllen Giants hosted minor league home games at Paris Field. The ballpark had a capacity of 3,000.

[[Data imaginaries]]

CATEGORIES: Sociological terminology, Discourse analysis

Data imaginaries are a form of cultural imaginary related to social conceptions of data, a concept that comes from the field of critical data studies. A data imaginary is a particular framing of data that defines what data are and what can be done with them. Imaginaries are produced by social institutions and practices and they influence how people understand and use the object of the imaginary, in this case data.

Different data imaginaries compete to be considered common sense. The current most established data imaginary is that of data analytics, which treats data as a neutral resource from which people can extract value. Competing imaginaries include those of data activists, prioritizing data justice, and critical data studies, prioritizing consideration of the context around data.

==Theoretical basis==

A data imaginary is a particular framing of data, according to Kitchin consisting of "how data are understood and normatively conceived of within a population or by stakeholders." It is a social constructivist theoretical concept that comes from the field of critical data studies, which is concerned with identifying these frames and questioning them rather than just taking them at face value. According to Baack, this context is important to consider, as "what data afford to whom does not only depend on the technological properties of data, but is fundamentally social, and both culturally and historically situated." Examining data imaginaries treats the narratives around data as separate from the data themselves, focusing on the former.

The concept of data imaginaries draws on the sociological imaginary. In sociology, imaginaries are social constructions that stem from social institutions and practices that prioritize different aspects of a social structure, in this case ideas about the use of data. According to Vanheeswijck, one of the most significant writers on this topic is Charles Taylor in his book A Secular Age, which defines social imaginaries as common understandings that facilitate collective actions and exist in cultural practices rather than being theoretically articulated. Another contributory work to this field is Benedict Anderson's book Imagined Communities, which argues that nationalism is based in "imagined communities" formed around geography and data tools such as censuses. This concept is a geographically focused understanding of data imaginaries. Theories of the social imaginary assert that these constructions are not fake or meaningless, as they direct how people think about a concept like data and what they think is able to be done with them. According to Denick, social imaginaries enable social practices by providing ways to understand the world. Data imaginaries are the narratives that shape how people conceive of and act upon data, though data do not always live up to the ideal aspirations presented.

==Competing imaginaries==

According to Kitchin, "different groups hold varying data imaginaries, concerning what data are generated and how, for what purpose," and how they "can serve particular agendas." People with differing opinions on how data should be used may share the same imaginary, which is concerned instead with how data can be used. People with alternative data imaginaries can challenge and reinterpret dominant ideas to promote their own understandings. Since this is a competition of ideas, a particular imaginary is 'successful' when people, the more the better, consider that imaginary common sense, i.e. the obvious way the world works.

===Data analytics===

The data analytics imaginary is the most established one in modern western society. Kitchin has defined it as framing data as "speedy (rapid insights), accessible (easily interpreted), revealing (extracting hidden knowledge), panoramic (all-seeing), prophetic (able to foresee and shape the future), and smart (possessing latent intelligence)." This imaginary treats data as a single social or economic resource akin to a product like oil, requiring an equivalent supporting infrastructure. Data are considering a mine-able resource from which value can be extracted.

An example of the influence of this framing, according to Cinnamon, is how data are considered the primary solution for urban challenges. Furthermore, grassroots civic activism involving data often embraces this imaginary, challenging particular uses of data but not the notions of how they can be used.

===Data activists===

Data activists have competing imaginaries to the more common data analytics imaginary. These can vary depending on individual priorities, as they are not as well established, but they tend to prioritize data justice and community-oriented politics. These imaginaries challenge current assumptions around datafication in the modern world.

An example of this framing being used, according to Segura and Waisbord, is activist efforts to oppose social and institutional issues such as gender-based violence and police violence in Latin America by documenting the problems and using the data gathered to advocate for solutions. Under this perspective, data are treated as tools to achieve some form of justice rather than as a neutral resource.

===Critical data studies===

Critical data studies, the academic discipline that produced the notion of data imaginaries, has its own imaginary. This imaginary is particularly concerned with the role of power and politics, seeing data as situated within "a complex assemblage that actively shapes their constitution" according to Rob Kitchin, a leading scholar in the field. Critical data studies challenges the assumption that data are inherently neutral, calling out the framing processes that arise in the methodologies and epistemologies that are applied to data.

Sabbath Eve in a Coal Cellar, Ludlow Street is a black and white photograph taken by Danish American photographer Jacob Riis probably c. 1890.

==Description==

Riis in his photographic and journalistic work documented the working life of emigrants of many different origins, like the Italian, the Irish, the Chinese and the Jews. This photograph became one of the most idiosyncratic depictions of Jewish emigrants in New York of the late 19th-century. It was taken at Ludlow Street, in the Lower East Side, in New York, and depicts a Jewish man, sturdy and bearded, poorly dressed, with his hat hanging above him on a peg, most likely an emigrant, who is celebrating the Jewish festivity of the Sabbath in a very poor environment, which is the coal cellar where he lives and works as a cobbler. The man does have a table prepared for the celebration, covered with a cloth and with the braided bread known as challah, and other utensils, in an attempt to maintain the tradition with dignity in a very poor place. To the left its visible a placard written in Yiddish. To the right, a man is barely visible, carrying a shovel, probably a working companion, since he was almost totally cropped from the photograph. The surprised look of the man is most likely due to the effect of the flash photographs used by Riis sometimes had on the people he captured on camera, often without their permission.

==Public collections==

There are prints of this photograph at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York, the Museum of the City of New York, and at the International Center of Photography, in New York.

[[Certified Organic Sunscreen]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Environment and health, Skin care, Sustainability task force articles, Environment articles by importance

A Certified Organic Sunscreen, also known as Petrochemical-Free Sunscreen, is a third party certified sunscreen consisting of certified and approved organic ingredients, with typically zinc oxide acting as the photo-protector. An organic sunscreen is verified and approved by a certifier to an international organic standard, such as NSF/ANSI 305, which define production and labelling requirements for personal care products containing organic ingredients. Generally speaking, sunscreen has photo-protective properties that reduce the risk of skin cancer and ageing with relation to the SPF value and proper application.

Certified organic sunscreen is part of a broader trend towards certified organic cosmetics and certified natural cosmetics. Especially in the sunscreen market, developers have been 'pushed' towards alternatives to petrochemical UV filters due to their lack of safety data and their detrimental ecological effects, which has resulted in various petrochemical UV filters being banned in different countries and ecological areas.

Organisations that manage standards and certifiers generally provide allowances for natural ingredients, such as water, as well as minerals such zinc oxide and titanium dioxide towards their organic calculation as they have photo-protective properties and a well regarded safety profile.

Certified Organic refers to the processing and production of a personal care product without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, petrochemicals, aromatic hydrocarbons and other contaminants or practices. Petrochemical suppliers may promote their ingredients as organic compounds; however, it is essential not to confuse this with the term "organic" or "certified organic". In this context, "organic compounds" simply means that the substances are derived from petroleum sources. Marketing products under organic is protected by consumer commissions such as the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission and other national bodies.

==Major standards==

===NSF/ANSI 305: Organic Personal Care Products===

Created by Non-For Profit Organization NSF. It is an International Standard designed specifically for Organic Personal Care Products. The NSF itself is a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Food and Water Safety and Indoor Environment.

===USDA National Organic Program (NOP)===

Due to the fact that the FDA does not define or regulate the term “organic” in personal care products, the USDA has taken responsibility. The USDA, United States Department of Agriculture, has been regulating organic cosmetics and personal care products, effective since 2001, under the National Organic Program. Unlike personal care products, sunscreen is regulated by the FDA as an OTC drug and thus has a GRASE monograph, so it is possible that the FDA may expand its role in regulating organic sunscreen in the future. Currently only zinc oxide and titanium dioxide have been determined by the FDA to be generally recognised as safe and effective (GRASE).

===ISO 16128: Natural and organic cosmetic ingredients and products===

ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is an independent, non-governmental international organisation with a membership of 167 national standards bodies. Cosmos has claimed the ISO:16128 standard is overly broad, despite being on the committee that made and approved it. The ISO:16128 standard is an official contributor to UN's Sustainable Development Goals; 3,12

===Ecocert Cosmos Organic===

The Cosmos Natural and Organic standard was established in 2002. It does not calculate natural minerals, such as zinc oxide, towards the organic percentage of a product, as the standard was heavily adapted off of existing organic agricultural standards .

===Natrue===

Natrue was created in 2007. The first Natrue labelled product launched in 2009. There are now over 7000 Natrue certified products. The standard is for natural and organic cosmetics.

==Green approved list of ingredient for certified organic sunscreens==

Certified organic sunscreens or products must comply with certifiers 'green list' of ingredients that are safe and represent their organic standard. Ingredients that are not permitted generally include: Silicones, Parabens, Microplastics, Synthetic Fragrances, Synthetic Colorants, Petrochemicals and certain preservatives such as Phenoxyethanol. As well as contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, PCBs, radioactivity, mycotoxins, nitrates, nitrosamines.

==Certified organic production practices==

Major organic certifiers prohibit animal testing for the product to carry their label  and European certifiers generally require the ingredients to be non-GMO. Organic certifiers do not allow the use of synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilisers in the production of certified organic ingredients. Cross contamination has been citied as a major cause of benzene contamination in sunscreens and organic production practices generally prohibit this practice by requiring organic only production facilities. Reported cases of benzene contamination have resulted in sunscreen recalls initiated by regulators such as the TGA and FDA or voluntarily by the brand. Other reasons why the contamination likely occurred was the degradation of benzene-based ingredients, such as petrochemical UV filters or from supply chain neglect. Most notably Valisure, an independent Connecticut based laboratory, found benzene contamination in products such as sunscreen, deodorant and hand sanitiser resulting in over 25 million products being recalled in the US since 2019.

==Active ingredients in certified organic sunscreen==

Petrochemical UV filters are not recognised as organic by most private certifiers, such as Cosmos (standard), as they are a byproduct of petroleum. Certified organic and natural UV protectors Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide, "TiO2 and ZnO, represent the only effective alternatives to ultraviolet (UV) filters of petrochemical origin regarding photoprotection, and they contribute significantly to the safety of consumers who use them."

==Ecological advantages of certified organic sunscreen==

Certified Organic Sunscreen bans the use of petrochemicals active ingredients that are generally harmful to the environment such as Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, Octinoxate. Avobenzone, for example, is one of the most frequently used UV filters on the market and  has been shown to cause damage to marine ecosystems such as coral reefs and harm marine life. Avobenzone has also been shown to absorb into your bloodstream after application in an FDA funded study. Oxybenzone and Octinoxate were also both banned in Hawaii over studies showing toxicity towards marine life.

[[Pyrenidium]]

CATEGORIES: Pleosporales, Taxa described in 1865, Dothideomycetes genera, Lichenicolous fungi, Taxa named by William Nylander (botanist)

Pyrenidium is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi. It is the only genus in the family Pyrenidiaceae. It has 13 species.

==Taxonomy==

The genus was circumscribed by Finnish lichenologist William Nylander in 1865, with Pyrenidium actinellum assigned as the type species. The family was originally proposed by Alexander Zahlbruckner in 1898, and later resurrected for use in 2019. Pyrenidium was previously classified in Dacampiaceae, but molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that this family was polyphyletic, and that Pyrenidium originated from a lineage distinct from the genera in that family.

==Description==

Members of the genus have ascomata that are perithecioid in form, often with blue-green pigment in the upper wall of the peridia. Their ascomata are either immersed in the host thallus, or bursting through surface (erumpent), exposing the upper part of the structure (sometimes still covered by tissue of the host thalli). They have bitunicate asci that contain from 4 to 8 ascospores. Infection by the fungus sometimes causes gall-like malformations of the host thallus.

==Species==

2022, Species Fungorum (in the Catalogue of Life) accepts 13 species of Pyrenidium:

[[Death of Hadis Najafi]]

Hadis Najafi (حدیث نجفی, January 5, 2000 – September 21, 2022) was an Iranian woman who died after being struck by gunfire in Mehrshahr, Karaj, during the 2022 Iranian protests following the death of Mahsa Amini. Her death has been widely reported in international media, and like Amini before her, Najafi also became a symbol of female empowerment and the ongoing protests against the Iranian government.

==Background==

Hadis Najafi was born in Karaj on 5 January 2000. She was the fourth child of the family, having three older sisters and one younger brother. Her parents were born in Mianeh in the East Azerbaijan province and were Iranian Azerbaijanis. Najafi had a diploma in fashion design and worked as a cashier at a restaurant in Mehrshahr, Karaj.

Najafi had joined the Mahsa Amini protests of September 2022, which were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, who died due to injuries while in police custody. Amini was accused by police of violating the mandatory hijab law, and related demonstrations have shown wide support for increasing women's rights in Iran. Najafi participated in protests in Karaj. Najafi had no known prior engagement in activist causes and had not previously spoken openly on women's rights in Iran. On the night of 21 September, she sent a video to a friend in which she said "I like to think that when I think about this a few years later I'll be pleased I joined the protest." She left her house around thirty minutes before she was killed.

==Death==

Hadis Najafi is reported to have been shot on Eram Boulevard in Mehrshahr, Karaj, on 21 September 2022, around 8 pm. She was reportedly shot at least six times in the face, hand, neck, abdomen and heart. According to her family, she had been hit by at least twenty bullets. According to the Iranian government, she was shot by protesters with weapons not used by police officers, a claim strongly disputed by Najafi's own family, other activists, and the international media. These parties instead all attributed the shooting to the government-backed security forces. After being shot, Najafi was taken to Ghaem Hospital in Karaj, where she was pronounced dead. The official medical records released claimed that she had died due to a "swelling of the brain".

According to Najafi's mother, her family was not allowed to see her in the hospital after she was shot, being barred from entry by police officers. They were only allowed in after a security guard took pity on them and told them that Najafi's body was in the morgue. Radio Zamaneh published Nafaji's death certificate. Images of her injuries and certificate of death were later confirmed by Amnesty International and BBC Persian after contact with her family. 

The authorities released Najafi's body to her family for burial on 23 September. According to the family they were pressured by the government to say that she had died of a heart attack. Najafi's father was also reportedly drugged and pressured by security forces to say she died of natural causes. 

==Burial and chehellom==

Najafi was buried on 1 October at the Behesht-e Sakineh cemetery. Security forces were reportedly present during the ceremony. Also present were many women, who lit candles and left roses at her grave. During the funeral ceremony, a picture of Najafi wearing a hijab was used, which later sparked some criticism on social media; her mother later stated that the image was not intentionally selected and that it was the only available image at that moment.

On 3 November, forty days after her death, thousands of mourners tried to attend the chehellom memorial gathering at the Beheshte Sakineh cemetery, but were blocked by government forces, according to witnesses. Hundreds of mourners instead marched on Beheshti Boulevard. Video verified by The Washington Post shows protestors throwing rocks at security forces, and a 17-year-old shot and killed by a member of the security forces. As of April 2023, the government had arrested fifteen people, sentenced five of the arrested to death, and carried out two executions, with the remaining three death sentences under judicial review.

==Reactions==

Najafi's death was shared on social media by the Iranian-American journalist and activist Masih Alinejad. After Najafi's death a video purporting to show her tying her hair into a ponytail before joining the protests on her last night alive became viral on social media, eventually also being widely shared by international news outlets reporting on her death. The video was later determined to show another woman partaking in the protests after BBC Persian was contacted by the woman who actually appears in the video. This sparked some brief doubts on whether Najafi had actually been killed, though they were quickly quelled with further confirmation. The woman in the video told BBC Persian that she would continue to "fight for the Mahsas and Hadis."

Like Mahsa Amini before her, Hadis Najafi was also turned into a symbol and rallying point for the protests after her death, and remembered for her courage. Her TikTok and Instagram accounts became memorials and received an influx of people who liked and commented on them in her support. There were also widespread tributes in Najafi's honor on Twitter. 

Najafi's sister and mother publicly spoke in her support and blamed her death on the Iranian government. Although her father refused to state that she had died of natural causes, he claimed in an interview with government-aligned media that Najafi had "known nothing of politics", stated that he did not believe the police had killed her, and blamed her death on her being influenced by foreign media. Najafi's sister, on the contrary, stated that Najafi had decided to participate in the protests due to having been heartbroken and outraged over the fate of Mahsa Amini.

Omid Nouripour, co-leader of the German political party Alliance 90/The Greens, started a speech in the federal parliament of Germany on 29 September 2022 with describing Hadis Najafi's participation in the protests and her death. Luciano Spalletti, the head coach of Italian Serie A club Napoli, brought two roses in memory of Mahsa Amini and Hadis Najafi to a press conference on 30 September 2022.

Morrison Harris Heckscher (born December 12, 1940) is an American retired curator and art historian who served as the Lawrence A. Fleischman Chair of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 2001 to 2014. He had worked in various curatorial roles at the Met since 1966. As chair, he oversaw a complete renovation of the interior and exhibits. He is a recipient of the Antique Dealers' Association Award of Merit and the Winterthur Museum's Henry Francis du Pont Award.

==Early life and education==

Heckscher was born and raised west of Philadelphia and educated at the Episcopal Academy. His grandfather, Morris Harris, made furniture as a hobby and inspired his grandson's youthful dream of moving to rural Vermont to become a cabinetmaker. Heckscher received his BA degree in American history from Wesleyan University in 1962, his MA from the Winterthur Program in Early American Culture at the University of Delaware in 1964, and his PhD in art history from Columbia University (ABD 1968; PhD 1986). His dissertation focused on English architect and interior designer William Kent. Mentors included Samuel M. Green at Wesleyan, Charles F. Montgomery at Winterthur, and Rudolf Wittkower at Columbia. He developed special interests in 18th-century American furniture and 19th- and 20th-century American architecture.

==Career at the Met==

Heckscher arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1966 under a Chester Dale Fellowship to work with English architectural drawings in the prints department. His career in the American Wing began in 1968, when he became assistant curator of American decorative arts. He put his dissertation on hold to accept the full-time role and ultimately received his PhD in 1986. He gained promotions to Curator of American Decorative Arts in 1978, to Anthony W. and Lulu C. Wang Curator of American Decorative Arts in 1998, and to Lawrence A. Fleischman Chair of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2001. As chair, he envisioned and oversaw the decade-long renovation and reinstallation of the entire American Wing, culminating in galleries of American paintings and sculpture that opened to acclaim in 2012. Heckscher retired in 2014 and now serves as curator emeritus of the American Wing. Sylvia Yount, former chief curator at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, succeeded him as chair.

==Scholarly contributions==

Heckscher mounted numerous Met exhibitions with accompanying catalogs: In Quest of Comfort: The Easy Chair in America (1971), An Architect and His Client: Frank Lloyd Wright and Francis W. Little (1973), The Architecture of Richard Morris Hunt (1986), American Rococo: Elegance in Ornament, 1750–1775 (with Leslie Greene Bowman, 1992), American Furniture and the Art of Connoisseurship (1998); John Townsend: Newport Cabinetmaker (2005); The Metropolitan Museum of Art: An Architectural History, 1870–1995 (1995); and Creating Central Park (2008). His monograph American Furniture in The Metropolitan Museum of Art: The Late Colonial Period, Vol. II: Queen Anne and Chippendale Styles (1985) won the Charles F. Montgomery Award of the Decorative Arts Society. Heckscher has served in leadership roles at the New York Chapter of the Society of Architectural Historians, the Society of Winterthur Fellows, the Winterthur Museum, Locust Grove Estate, Scenic Hudson, and Strawbery Banke.

==Awards==

==Personal life==

Heckscher married Fenella Grieg in 1974. She is a British-born retired pediatric endocrinologist who attended the University of Oxford. The couple owns a rustic summer home on Louds Island in Maine and a Gothic Revival house near Newburgh in upstate New York, in addition to an apartment on the West Side of Manhattan.

St. George's Anglican Church is a historic Anglican parish in Helmetta, New Jersey. Built as St. George's Episcopal Church to serve families residing in the company town for George Washington Helme's snuff mill, the congregation left the Episcopal Church in 2010 and joined the Anglican Church in North America.

==History==

Before his death in 1893, Helme planned the church for mill workers residing in Helmetta. Architect William Horatio Day designed the church, parsonage and lych gate in a Queen Anne Gothic style. The church was built by Helme's family and heirs in 1894.

A stone parish hall was added in the 1960s.

In 2010, as part of the broader Anglican realignment in North America, St. George's agreed to pay a settlement to the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey to leave the Episcopal Church with its property. The church joined the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, affiliated with the Church of Nigeria, and the Diocese of CANA East, which eventually became the Diocese of the Living Word.

==Architecture==

The G. W. Helme Snuff Mill District is a classic example of a late 1800s mill town. St. George's is today a contributing property to the historic district, which was named to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on February 1, 1980, and to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, New Jersey, on August 15, 1980.

The NRHP nomination for the district describes St. George's exterior as a "somewhat awkward, idiosyncratic variation on Queen Anne gothic," with stone gable-end walls, shingled side walls, a stone side tower and lancet arch windows.

CATEGORIES: Statutes of New Zealand, 2022 in New Zealand law, Children's rights legislation, Children's rights in New Zealand, Child welfare in New Zealand

The Children and Young People's Commission Act 2022 is a New Zealand Act of Parliament that establishes the Children and Young People's Commission and repeals the Children's Commissioner Act 2003. The Bill was formerly part of the proposed "Oversight of the Oranga Tamariki System and Children and Young People's Commission Bill" until it was split into two separate pieces of legislation by the New Zealand Parliament on 11 August 2022. Together, the bill and the companion Oversight of Oranga Tamariki System Act 2022 replaced the Office of the Children's Commissioner, the independent national Children's ombudsman. 

==Key provisions==

The Children and Young People's Commission Act 2022's key provisions include:

==History==

===Combined bill===

In November 2021, the Sixth Labour Government introduced the "Oversight of the Oranga Tamariki System and Children and Young People's Commission Bill" which proposed replacing the Office of the Children's Commissioner with two new entities: a "Children and Young People's Commission" focusing on advocacy work and an Independent Children's Monitor within the Education Review Office focusing on monitoring. This bill was developed by the Minister of Social Development Carmel Sepuloni based on advice from Ministry for Social Development (MSD) officials. The proposed law change was driven by the Government's concern that the Office of the Children's Commissioner's advocacy role would clash with its monitoring role.

The Government's Oranga Tamariki Oversight Bill passed its first reading on 16 November 2021 by a margin of 108 to 12 votes. While the ruling Labour Party, opposition National Party, and the ACT Party supported the bill, it was opposed by the Green Party and the Māori Party. The bill was subsequently referred to the Social Services and Community select committee.

By 26 January 2022, the select committee had received 403 submissions from interested groups and individuals; with 311 opposing the bill and eight supporting the bill. While Labour supported the Oranga Tamariki System Oversight Bill, the National, ACT, and Green parties objected to the bill, citing the large number of opposing submissions and urging the Government to wait until the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Historical Abuse in State Care had concluded its hearings. In June 2022, the select committee recommended the bill but made several recommendations including incorporating references to the Treaty of Waitangi, defining "care or custody providers," strengthening the independent monitor's role, and creating the position of Chief Children's Commissioner to head the Children and Young People's Commission. In response,  Children's Commissioner Judge Frances Eivers criticised the select committee for proceeding with the legislation without waiting for the Royal Commission to conclude its hearings.

On 27 July 2022, the Oranga Tamariki Oversight Bill passed its second reading by a margin of 65 to 54. While Labour supported the legislation, it was opposed by the National, Green, ACT, and Māori parties.

===Separate legislation===

Following the "committee of the whole House" meeting held on 11 August, the legislation was split into two bills; namely the Children and Young People's Commission Act 2022 and the Oversight of Oranga Tamariki System Act 2022. On 23 August, these two bills passed their third combined reading. While the Labour Party supported the bills, they were opposed by the   National, ACT, Green and Māori parties. In addition,  Eivers, several children's advocates including Child Matters, Save the Children, and Social Justice Aotearoa, and the human rights organisations Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission voiced opposition to the Government's reforms of the Oranga Tamariki oversight system.

The McAllen Dusters were a minor league baseball franchise based in McAllen, Texas. In 1977, the Dusters played as members of the Class A level Lone Star League, hosting home games at the McAllen High School Field. The Dusters finished last in 1977, which proved to be the final season of the league.

==History==

The Dusters were preceded in minor league play by the 1950 McAllen Giants, who played as members of the Class D level Rio Grande Valley League.

In 1977, the McAllen "Dusters" played the season as members of the short–lived, six–team, Class A level Lone Star League. The Beeville Blazers, Corpus Christi Seagulls, Harlingen Suns, Texas City Stars and Victoria Rosebuds joined McAllen in beginning league play on June 10, 1977.

The Dusters began the season with a record of 9–21, their nickname reflective of crop dusting and continual windy conditions in McAllen.

The McAllen Dusters ended the 1977 Lone Star League season with an overall record of 33–45, finishing last in the league standings. Playing the season under managers Shannon Kelly and Jack Allen, McAllen finished 19.0 games behind the 1st place Corpus Christi Seagulls. The league did not hold playoffs as a hurricane hit the region just after the season ended. The Dusters scored the least amount of runs in the league. Duster players Jim Willis drove in 48 runs to lead the team, while  Barry Scarpellino hit .303. Pitcher Thomas Linnert led the team with 7 wins, while Joseph Laniak recorded a 3.17 ERA. The Lone Star League permanently folded following the 1977 season.

McAllen next hosted minor league baseball in 2011, when the McAllen Thunder began play as members of the independent North American League.

==The ballpark==

The McAllen Dusters hosted 1977 minor league home games at the McAllen High School Field. The Dusters franchise rented the ballfield from the high school to host 1977 league games.McAllen High School is located at 2021 La Vista Avenue.

Pierre Baroni (30 October 1955 – 9 March 2021) was an Australian radio broadcaster, artist, and musician.

==Career==

Pierre Baroni was born in Kew, Victoria in 1955, and grew up in Glenroy. He was a member of Melbourne pub band Carmine in the mid-1970s who were described by Ian "Molly" Meldrum as "one of the future top bands of Australia" on his Countdown tv program. After the band broke up, Baroni formed Power by Beat! (P.X.B.) in 1977, who released one EP in 1978.

In late 1980, Baroni joined New Wave band The Aliens, who had previously released singles and an album on Mushroom Records. After Baroni joined, The Aliens released their single I Don’t Care in 1981 and then broke up. During this time he began DJing his collection of 60s vinyl records at a Monday night called Shout, run by Rob Furst, owner of Beat Magazine, before joining his brother Dean Baroni in a new band Filed of Knives, who then became The Pony.

Formed in 1986, The Pony released two albums Thorns and Cutlery (1987) and Memories of Daydreams (1989) before breaking up in 1990.

Baroni then began working in the art department for Mushroom Records in 1990, designing record covers, and later directing music videos. After three months he was promoted to Art Director, and he created artwork for albums such as Archie Roach’s Charcoal Lane, and others for Tina Arena and Jimmy Barnes. His work for Mushroom was nominated and won ARIA Awards for Best Cover Art.

During the 90s, Baroni was a regular guest on Vince Peach's Soul Time radio program for Melbourne community radio station PBS. He then began presenting his own program Soulgroove’66 in 2003, sourcing records from his own collection of around 5,000 soul, funk and R&B singles.

In March 2021 he died from cancer, with PBS posting a series of tributes from his friends and listeners of his radio program. The theme song to Soulgroove’66 by Renée Geyer was released on vinyl as a tribute to Baroni following the news of his death. The recording featured Geyer and Baroni with organist Jake Mason, drummer Danny Farrugia, and bass player Yuri Pavlinov as the fictional band The New Cobras.

Pierre Baroni was inducted posthumously into Music Victoria’s Hall of Fame at the 2021 Music Victoria Awards, with tributes from Jimmy Barnes and Archie Roach.

CATEGORIES: 1997 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, NASCAR races at Sonoma Raceway, May 1997 sports events in the United States, 1997 in sports in California

The 1997 Save Mart Supermarkets 300 was the ninth stock car race of the 1997 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, the third race of the 1997 NASCAR Winston West Series, and the ninth iteration of the event. The race was held on Sunday, May 4, 1997, in Sonoma, California, at the Grand Prix layout of Sears Point Raceway, a 2.52 permanent road course layout. The race took the scheduled 74 laps to complete. At race's end, Roush Racing driver Mark Martin would dominate the majority of the race to take his 19th career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory and his first victory of the season. To fill out the top three, Jeff Gordon and Terry Labonte, both driving for Hendrick Motorsports, would finish second and third, respectively.

==Background==

Sears Point Raceway is one of two road courses to hold NASCAR races, the other being Watkins Glen International. The standard road course at Sears Point Raceway is a 12-turn course that is 2.52 long; the track was modified in 1998, adding the Chute, which bypassed turns 5 and 6, shortening the course to 1.95. The Chute was only used for NASCAR events such as this race, and was criticized by many drivers, who preferred the full layout. In 2001, it was replaced with a 70-degree turn, 4A, bringing the track to its current dimensions of 1.99.

===Entry list===

==Qualifying==

Qualifying was split into two rounds. The first round was held on Friday, May 3, at 6:00 PM EST. Each driver would have one lap to set a time. During the first round, the top 25 drivers in the round would be guaranteed a starting spot in the race. If a driver was not able to guarantee a spot in the first round, they had the option to scrub their time from the first round and try and run a faster lap time in a second round qualifying run, held on Saturday, May 4, at 1:00 PM EST. As with the first round, each driver would have one lap to set a time. Positions 26-38 would be decided on time, and depending on who needed it, the 39th thru either the 42nd, 43rd, or 44th position would be based on provisionals. Four spots are awarded by the use of provisionals based on owner's points. The fifth is awarded to a past champion who has not otherwise qualified for the race. If no past champion needs the provisional, the field would be limited to 42 cars. If a champion needed it, the field would expand to 43 cars. If the race was a companion race with the NASCAR Winston West Series, four spots would be determined by NASCAR Winston Cup Series provisionals, while the final two spots would be given to teams in the Winston West Series, leaving the field at 44 cars.

Mark Martin, driving for Roush Racing, would win the pole, setting a time of 1:37.751 and an average speed of 92.807.

13 drivers would fail to qualify: Rick Mast, Joe Nemechek, R. K. Smith, Robert Pressley, Chad Little, Gary Smith, David Green, Dick Trickle, Chuck Pruett, Bill McAnally, Scott Gaylord, Wayne Jacks, and Rick Scribner.

Contested over 500 laps on the .526 mile (.847 km) short track, it was the 35th race of the 2022 NASCAR Cup Series season, the ninth race of the Playoffs, and final race of the Round of 8.

This race, won by Christopher Bell, was noted for Ross Chastain's "Hail Melon" finish, in which Chastain rode the wall in a move described as similar to those done in racing video games to secure a fourth-place finish that locked him to the Championship 4 race. Chastain's move also set an all-new track record.

==Report==

===Background===

Martinsville Speedway is an International Speedway Corporation-owned NASCAR stock car racing track located in Henry County, in Ridgeway, Virginia, just to the south of Martinsville. At 0.526 in length, it is the shortest track in the NASCAR Cup Series. The track is also one of the first paved oval tracks in NASCAR, being built in 1947 by H. Clay Earles. It is also the only race track that has been on the NASCAR circuit from its beginning in 1948.

The 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race was a NASCAR Cup Series race held on November 6, 2022, at Phoenix Raceway in Avondale, Arizona. Contested over 312 laps on the one mile (1.6 km) oval, it was the 36th and final race of the 2022 NASCAR Cup Series season.

==Report==

===Background===

Phoenix Raceway – also known as PIR – is a one-mile, low-banked tri-oval race track located in Avondale, Arizona. It is named after the nearby metropolitan area of Phoenix. The motorsport track opened in 1964 and currently hosts two NASCAR race weekends annually. PIR has also hosted the IndyCar Series, CART, USAC and the Rolex Sports Car Series. The raceway is currently owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.

The raceway was originally constructed with a 2.5 road course that ran both inside and outside of the main tri-oval. In 1991 the track was reconfigured with the current 1.51 interior layout. PIR has an estimated grandstand seating capacity of around 67,000. Lights were installed around the track in 2004 following the addition of a second annual NASCAR race weekend.

Phoenix Raceway is home to two annual NASCAR race weekends, one of 13 facilities on the NASCAR schedule to host more than one race weekend a year. The track is both the first and last stop in the western United States, as well as the fourth and the last track on the schedule.

On October 28, 2022, Hendrick Motorsports announced that Alex Bowman would return to the No. 48 car for this race, having sat out the rest of Round of 12 and Round of 8 races (eliminating himself from Round of 12) after he suffered a concussion at the Texas playoff race.

CATEGORIES: 12th-century births, 1213 deaths, 12th-century people from the county of Flanders, Christians of the Third Crusade, People of the Reconquista, People from Silves, Portugal, Bishops of Viseu

Nicholas (died 1213) was the bishop of Silves (1189–1191) and bishop of Viseu (1192–1213) during the Portuguese Reconquista.

A native of Flanders and a clergyman, Nicholas joined an international maritime expedition intending to take part in the Third Crusade. His fleet assisted King Sancho I of Portugal in besieging Silves from 21 July to 3 September 1189. After the fall of Silves, according to an eyewitness account, the De itinere navali, the newly appointed Portuguese governor named Nicholas bishop. Some of his fellow Flemings opted to remain in Silves with him while the rest of the crusaders continued on to the Holy Land. The governor, however, asked Nicholas to intercede and convince the crusaders to help him take Faro. He was unable to secure general agreement and the attack did not take place.

According to Ralph of Diceto, only five days after the city fell, on the Nativity of Mary (8 September), Nicholas dedicated the mosque as the cathedral of the Blessed Virgin. The names of three members of his chapter are known: William the dean, Peter the treasurer and Lambert the archdeacon. They may have been among those Flemings who chose to stay with him in Silves. William was sent to Flanders to recruit settlers for the new diocese.

Before the end of the year 1189, Nicholas had received several privileges from King Sancho and a villa at Mafra. In December, he witnessed the king's donation of the castle of Alvor to the monastery of Santa Cruz de Coimbra. In March 1190, at Sancho's request, he granted canonical jurisdiction over the castle of Lagos to the monastery of São Vicente de Fora, the king having already granted the castle to the monastery. That summer, the Almohads besieged Silves. According to Roger of Howden, when a ship bearing English crusaders arrived, Nicholas begged them to take part in the city's defence. The citizens went further and scuttled their ship. After they were promised a replacement ship, they agreed to join the defence. The Almohads ultimately lifted the siege.

In February 1191, Nicholas witnessed a royal donation to the monastery of Alcobaça. That summer, the Almohads returned and once again besieged Silves, which surrendered on 25 July. A year later, on 7 July 1192, Bishop João Peres of Viseu died. Before the month was out, Nicholas had been appointed his replacement. His activities at Viseu can be traced in six documents between February 1196 and December 1210.

Nicholas died on 25 October 1213 or possibly 1214.

[[Question...?]]

CATEGORIES: Taylor Swift songs, 2022 songs, American synth-pop songs, Songs written by Taylor Swift, Songs written by Jack Antonoff, Song recordings produced by Taylor Swift, Song recordings produced by Jack Antonoff

"Question...?" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, taken from her tenth original studio album, Midnights (2022). Swift wrote and produced the song with Jack Antonoff. A synth-pop track, "Question...?" has lyrics where a narrator ponders on a broken relationship and confronts the ex-lover with a series of rhetorical questions. It samples Swift's 2016 single "Out of the Woods". The song was released as a limited-time digital download from Midnights on October 25, 2022, by Republic Records.

In reviews of Midnights, some critics picked "Question...?" as an album highlight, praising the lyrical details and production. The song peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100, number 11 on the Billboard Global 200, and within the top 10 on charts of Canada, the Philippines, and Singapore.

==Background and release==

On August 28, 2022, during her acceptance speech for Video of the Year for All Too Well: The Short Film at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift announced her tenth studio album and its release date for October 21. Soon after, Swift revealed the name of the album, Midnights, and its album cover on social networks but the tracklist was not immediately revealed. Jack Antonoff, a musician who has worked with Swift since 1989 (2014), was revealed as one of the producers of the album through a video she posted on her Instagram account on September 6, 2022, titled, "The making of Midnights". On September 21, about a month before the album's release, Swift announced a thirteen-episode series called Midnights Mayhem with Me on the social media platform TikTok, and thereafter revealed the title of one album track each episode. The title of "Question...?", track number seven, was revealed on the third episode on September 26.

"Question...?" was released exclusively onto Swift's official website for a limited-time download offer on October 25, 2022. The instrumental version was released two days later. On the May 20, 2023, concert at Foxborough, Massachusetts as part of the Eras Tour, Swift performed an acoustic version of "Question...?" as a "surprise song" outside the regular set list.

==Composition==

===Production===

Swift wrote and produced "Question...?" with Antonoff, who programmed the track and recorded it at Rough Customer Studio, Brooklyn, and Electric Lady Studios, New York. On the track, Antonoff played the Juno 6 synthesizer, the Mellotron, and provided background vocals. The track features various drum players: Dominik Rivinius, whose performance was recorded by Ken Lewis at Neon Wave Studio, Pirmasens, Germany; Evan Smith, who recorded at Pleasure Hill Recording, Portland, Maine; and Sean Hutchinson, who recorded at Hutchinson Sound, Brooklyn. Serban Ghenea, assisted by Bryce Bordone, mixed "Question...?" at MixStar Studio, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Randy Merrill mastered it at Sterling Sound, Edgewater, New Jersey.

"Question...?" has a duration of three minutes and 30 seconds. It is a synth-pop song with sharp percussion beats. The track's beginning contains a sample of Swift's 2016 single "Out of the Woods", from the album 1989 (2014). At one point, the production incorporates sounds of a crowd cheering, which are credited to Antonoff, Antonoff's sister Rachel, Swift's brother Austin, and Dylan O'Brien. Some critics compared the song's arrangement and production to Swift's 2014 single, "Blank Space"; Carl Wilson from Slate said Swift interpolates her "descending-scale cadence" from the bridge of "Blank Space". In Billboard, Becky Kaminsky likened "Question...?" to Swift's 2017 album, Reputation.

===Lyrics===

In the lyrics, the narrator ruminates on a broken relationship and how things could have turned out differently. The song depicts the narrator as a "good girl" and the ex-lover as a "sad boy" in a big city. In the refrain, she wants to confront the ex-lover with a series of questions ("Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?" "Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight when she said it was too much?" "Do you wish you could still touch her?"), to which the answers she has already known. She subtly mocks her ex-lover's new love: "And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her, that's nice/ I'm sure that's what's suitable/ And right." Alejandra Gularte of Vulture described the song as suitable for an "anxious attached person that gets slightly comfortable with their partner".

Teen Vogue identified probable lyrical references to Swift's previous songs, such as kissing someone in "a crowded room" to "Dress" (from Reputation) and multiple mentions of late-night encounters with a love interest to many 1989 tracks including "Style", "All You Had to Do Was Stay", and "How You Get the Girl". NPR critic Ann Powers cited the lyrics, "Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room / And every single one of your friends was making fun of you / But 15 seconds later they were clapping too?", as a highlight portraying "a scene of romantic persuasion and betrayal". For Powers, the said lyrics encapsulate women's feelings and anxiety towards how they can be concerned by uncertain love, social pressure, and others' desires for them.

==Critical reception==

"Question...?" was met with positive reviews from critics. Carl Wilson considered the track his counterproposal for Midnights's lead single; he praised the song for "acknowledging the mix of nostalgia and distance that often accompanies such more mature thoughts". Powers was similarly positive, saying that the track "is the kind of story song only Swift can write" and that it captures the emotional sentiments to the details "so acutely that it stings".'' Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic said he was impressed by the song's "twisty storytelling and last-dance wistfulness". The A.V. Club journalist Saloni Gajjar wrote it contains "classic Swift charm and potent use of metaphors", and The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis selected it among the Midnights'' tracks that are "filled with subtle, brilliant touches".

For The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica, "Question...?" is one of the better album songs lyrically. Praising the production, Bobby Olivier from Spin found the track to have a radio hit potential. In Paste, Ellen Johnson lauded the song as a meticulously produced track, with a more nuanced and restrained production compared to common pop music. On a less complimentary side, Craig Jenkins from Vulture deemed the refrain "cloying". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard placed "Question...?" last on his ranking of Midnights tracks, writing that even though it is not the strongest album song, it "boasts some fascinating tidbits to pore over".

==Commercial performance==

Following the release of Midnights, tracks from the album occupied the entire top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100; "Question...?" opened at its peak of number seven on the chart with first-week figures of 31 million streams, 21,400 downloads, and 425,000 airplay impressions. The tracks made Swift the first artist to occupy the top 10 of the Hot 100 and the woman with the most top 10 entries (40), exceeding Madonna (38). On the Digital Songs chart, it became Swift's record-extending 24th number-one song, propelled by the limited-time downloads offered via her website. In Canada, the song peaked at number 10 on the Canadian Hot 100 and was certified gold by Music Canada for selling over 40,000 units. Elsewhere, "Question...?" charted at number seven in the Philippines and Singapore, number eight in Malaysia, number 11 in Australia, number 15 in Vietnam, number 20 in Iceland, number 21 in Portugal, and various positions in other countries. The song peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Global 200.

===ASTR===

Astar Network uses "ASTR" as the native token, which is used to pay for gas in transactions, as a governor's token for the ability to propose and vote on project policies, and as a reward for staking.。

===dApps staking===

dApps staking" is a system that rewards developers and users for staking the network's native token "ASTR" for dApps (distributed applications) and infrastructure integrated with the Astar Network. By staking ASTRs to specific dApps, it is possible to support developers while receiving rewards.。
